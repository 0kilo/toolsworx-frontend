# Task Plan: Tool Unit Test Plan

## Goal
Produce a clear plan to generate per-tool unit test files grouped by category under `tests/`, using fixtures in `tests/docs` and any additional minimal fixtures needed.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: Research/gather information
- [x] Phase 3: Draft deliverable
- [x] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions
1. Which tools require file-based fixtures vs API-only tests?
2. What test framework or runner should the plan target (currently none)?

## Decisions Made
- Plan targets API-level tests with per-tool files grouped by category.
- Reuse `tests/docs` fixtures and add minimal `tests/media` fixtures as needed.

## Errors Encountered
- None.

## Status
**Complete** - Plan delivered in `docs/tool-tests-plan.md`.
