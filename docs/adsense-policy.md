Next: Google Publisher Restrictions
We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new Publisher Policies Help Center. For now, you can still view all the policies in the AdMob, AdSense, and Ad Manager Help Centers, as well as the new Help Center. 
When you monetize your content with Google ad code you are required to adhere to the following policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in Google blocking ads from appearing against your content, or suspending or terminating your account.

These policies apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.

Google helps to enable a free and open internet by helping publishers monetize their content and advertisers reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Maintaining trust in the ads ecosystem requires setting limits on what we will monetize.

Google Publisher Policies are organized into the following categories:

Google AdSense
Manage your sitesGoogle AdSense content and user experience
Please make sure to visit Your AdSense Page where you can find personalized information about your account to help you succeed with AdSense.


Manage your sites
Google AdSense content and user experience
Next: Remove a site from your AdSense sites list
To monetize a site with AdSense, you should have unique and valuable content and provide a good user experience. Explore our tips here.

Provide enough unique content
For your site to be ready to show AdSense ads, make sure that your pages have enough unique content so that we can determine what your site is about. You should provide content that gives your users a reason to visit and return to your site.



For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon Image of YouTube settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select "Subtitles/CC" and choose your language.

 

When you create content, it’s important to ask yourself if it provides substantial value and originality when compared to other sites covering similar subjects, as this will attract more visitors to your site. Tools such as Google Trends can give you a feel for what people are interested in so you can tailor your content. Google Analytics includes many free-of-charge tools that can help you to build a more complete picture of your users and identify areas where you could improve your content marketing. For more information, visit our AdSense blog post on creating outstanding website content in 3 steps.

Additionally, make sure that you update your site regularly. Continually adding new and unique content will keep your site fresh and generate more returning visitors.

Also, don't forget to make sure that your content adheres to the Spam policies for Google web search. The Spam policies for Google web search recommend that you do not use cloaking and doorway pages, pages with little to no content, or pages optimized for specific keywords or phrases.

Make certain that there’s no duplicate content
As stated in the Google Publisher Policies, Google ads may not be placed on sites with scraped or copyrighted content. Some examples of scraping sites include:

Sites that copy and republish content from other sites without adding any original content or value
Sites that copy content from other sites, modify it slightly (for example, by substituting synonyms or using automated techniques), and republish it
Sites dedicated to embedding content such as video, images, or other media from other sites without substantial added value to the user
Be careful when using external resources such as external articles or embedded videos. It's important that you contribute your own original content, whether it's specialist knowledge, improvement ideas, reviews, or your personal thoughts. Check that the content on your site is unique and that fragments are not copied from other sites. Also ensure that the same content is not duplicated in the same page or across multiple pages of your site.

If you have many pages that are similar or have very similar content, consider expanding each page or consolidating the pages into one. Also, try to minimize repeating long segments of text in different pages of your site, for example, instead of including lengthy copyright text on the bottom of every page, include a very brief summary and then link to a page with more details. You can use the Parameter Handling tool to specify how you would like Google to treat URL parameters.

For more tips, review our guide on how to avoid creating duplicate content.

Build a good user experience with navigational elements
Providing original content is only one component of creating a high-quality site. Your content should also be informative and organized in a manner that's easy for users to navigate. Consider the arrangement of the elements (text, images, etc.) on your pages. Your layout should look inviting and visitors should be able to easily find what they're looking for.



For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon Image of YouTube settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select "Subtitles/CC" and choose your language.

 

An accessible, easy-to-use navigation bar (or menu bar) is a key part of providing a good user experience. When building your navigation bar, consider the following points:

Alignment - Are all the navigational elements lined up correctly across all devices?
Readability - Is the text content on your site easy to read?
Functionality - Do your drop-down lists work correctly? Are all navigational elements clickable?
Accuracy - Are the elements bringing the user to the right content?
After you've added unique content to your site, don’t forget to organize it. We recommend that you structure and organize your content as follows:

Add navigational elements to the menu bar and organize your content by topic, category, etc. This will help users to better understand and navigate your site.
Avoid repeating the same content in multiple categories or pages of your site or creating multiple pages or sites with content taken from other sources.
Make sure that your site provides the information and service promised and does not have links that lead to:
False claims of downloadable or streaming content
Missing pages
Irrelevant or misleading pages
Text on a page not related to the theme or business model of the site
Ensure that your site appears correctly in different browsers.
We recommend visiting our AdSense blog post on refining your website’s user experience in 3 steps.

Submit your site for review
Lastly, don’t forget to review the AdSense Program policies to ensure that the content on your site is compliant with our policies.

Building a high-quality site takes effort and time. When you’ve addressed the above points, submit your site for review through the Sites page in your AdSense account. The review process usually takes a few days and you’ll be notified about the review results through your AdSense account.

Google has detected low-quality pages or shallow pages on your site. Here are a few common examples of pages that often have thin content with little or no added value:

Thin affiliate pages
Content from other sources. For example: scraped content or low-quality guest blog posts
Doorways
These techniques don't provide users with substantially unique or valuable content, and are in violation of our spam policies.



Recommended actions
First, review the following sections of our spam policies:

Thin affiliate pages
Scraped content
Doorways
Next, follow the steps below to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

Check for content on your site that duplicates content found elsewhere.
Check for thin content pages with affiliate links on your site.
Check for doorway pages on your site.
If your site contains any of these types of content, think about whether your site provides significant added value for your users. 
Tip: Consider asking friends or family — real people not affiliated with your site — to use or critique your site to get ideas for improving it.
Improve your website so that it provides significant value for your users.
When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select Request Review on the Manual Actions report. Provide examples of bad content that you removed and good content that you added.
After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.


Spam policies for Google web search
You must not:

place Google-served ads on screens that violate the Spam policies for Google web search.
Tips for the Spam policies for Google web search
To ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, Google publishers are required to adhere to the Spam policies for Google web search. Following these policies will help you avoid negative experiences for your users, and reduce the chance of misleading advertisers. The policies are quite extensive so we’ve highlighted some important information below:

Avoid unnecessary, repeated use of keywords, which don’t add value to the site.
Your sites should not claim that they provide content or services that they do not have.
Don’t create "doorway" pages created just for search engines, or other "cookie cutter" approaches such as affiliate programs with little or no original content.
Please keep in mind that participation in Google advertising programs doesn't affect a site's rank in Google search results and won't queue its web pages for crawling by our main index bots. Publishers wishing to improve their ranking in the search results should visit the Google Search Essentials and Search Console, which are available to all publishers.

Sites that violate the Spam policies for Google web search may be omitted from Google search results, as well as having Google-served ads disabled under this policy. If this has happened to one of your sites, you can modify your site so that it does comply with the policies and then submit your site for reconsideration.
