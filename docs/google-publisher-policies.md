[Next: Google Publisher Restrictions](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10437795?hl=en&ref_topic=1250104)

We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new [Publisher Policies Help Center](https://support.google.com/publisherpolicies). For now, you can still view all the policies in the [AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/), [AdSense](https://support.google.com/adsense/), and [Ad Manager](https://support.google.com/admanager/) Help Centers, as well as the new Help Center. 

When you monetize your content with Google ad code you are required to adhere to the following policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in Google blocking ads from appearing against your content, or suspending or terminating your account.

These policies apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.

Google helps to enable a free and open internet by helping publishers monetize their content and advertisers reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Maintaining trust in the ads ecosystem requires setting limits on what we will monetize.

Google Publisher Policies are organized into the following categories:

*   [Content policies](#content)
*   [Behavioral policies](#behavioral)
*   [Privacy-related policies](#privacy)
*   [Requirements and other standards](#standards)

[Next: Understand the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10008391?hl=en&ref_topic=1250104)

We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new [Publisher Policies Help Center](https://support.google.com/publisherpolicies). For now, you can still view all the policies in the [AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/), [AdSense](https://support.google.com/adsense/), and [Ad Manager](https://support.google.com/admanager/) Help Centers, as well as the new Help Center. 

Google helps to enable a free and open internet by providing the ability for publishers to monetize their content and for advertisers to reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services.

Publisher restrictions identify content that is restricted from receiving certain sources of advertising. If your content is labeled with an inventory restriction, fewer advertising sources will be eligible to bid on it. In some cases this will mean that no advertising sources are bidding on your inventory and no ads will appear on your content. Please note that Google Ads (formerly AdWords) advertisements will not serve on content labeled with these restrictions. Therefore, while you can choose to monetize content covered by these Google Publisher Restrictions, this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content.

Google Publisher Restrictions are organized into the following categories:

*   [Content restrictions](#content_restrictions)
*   [Behavioral restrictions](#behavioral_restrictions)
*   [Video inventory restrictions](#video_inventory_restrictions)

These restrictions apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.

Video inventory restrictions
----------------------------

#### Definitions

*   "**In-stream**" means a video or audio ad played within the stream of video or audio content, where the video or audio content is the focus of the user's visit or explicitly requested by the user.
    
    Example: A video ad that is played before, in the middle of, or after the stream of a user-requested video content.
    
*   "**Accompanying Content**" means a video ad played within the stream of video content accompanying the main content of the user’s visit, where the video content is neither the focus of the user’s visit nor explicitly requested by the user. Accompanying Content placements must load within the body of the page, and muted by default.
    
    Example: A video ad that is played before, in the middle of, or after the stream of muted video content that takes up a small portion of a primarily editorial page.
    
*   "**Interstitial**" means a video ad played without the presence of any other streaming video content in a transition between content, where the video ad is the primary focus of the page and takes up the majority of the viewport.
    
    Example: A video ad that is independent of any other streaming video content, and that is placed in full view in a natural break or transition between content.
    
*   "**Standalone**" means a video ad played without the presence of any other streaming video content, where the video ad is not the focus of the page.
    
    Example: A video ad that is independent of any other streaming video content, and that is placed in a banner at the right rail of an article page.
    
*   "**Connected TV**", "**Digital out-of-home**", "**In-stream placement in CTV**" and "**Non-in-stream placement in CTV**" have the meanings as defined in the [Requirements for Connected TV and Digital out-of-home inventory](about:/admanager/answer/16127271#definitions).
    

#### Accurately describe inventory

1.  Video inventory must provide declarations with accurate signals (for Ad Manager, see [VAST ad tag URL parameters](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/10678356)), including:
    *   Audibility of ad placement: Audible (volume > 0 at the time of the ad request) by default or muted (for Ad Manager, see [`vpmute` parameter](about:/admanager/answer/10678356#vpmute)).
    *   Type of ad placement:
        *   For Connected TV or Digital out-of-home inventory: Placements must be accurately declared per the [Requirements for Connected TV and Digital out-of-home inventory](about:/admanager/answer/16127271#definitions).
        *   For inventory other than Connected TV and Digital out-of-home: Video ads serving into video players with video content must be accurately declared as either "In-stream" or "Accompanying Content" placements (for Ad Manager, see [`plcmt` parameter](about:/admanager/answer/10678356#plcmt)). Video ads serving into non-video player placements do not require declarations, and will be automatically determined by Google based on [inventory format](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9796545) as either "Interstitial" or "Standalone" placements.

**Note**: For Ad Manager, the terms "instream" or "in-stream" in Help Center pages and in-product controls refer to both "In-stream" and "Accompanying Content" as defined in these policies. Ad Manager Video Inventory that is "In-stream" or "Accompanying Content" per these policies must adhere to the respective requirements in these policies.

#### Use supported implementations

2.  In-stream or Accompanying Content placements must use the [Google Interactive Media Ads SDK](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads) or [Google Programmatic Access Library](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/pal) on supported platforms, unless through an official Google Beta program.
    *   Partners and publishers cannot use Interactive Media Ads products to monetize YouTube content. For YouTube content, partners and publishers must monetize through the [YouTube Partner Program](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851).
3.  Interstitial or Standalone placements must use Google-provided solutions: on web: [Google Publisher Tags](https://developers.google.com/publisher-tag/guides/get-started); in app: the Google Mobile Ads SDK ([for Ad Manager](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk); [for AdMob](https://developers.google.com/admob)).
    *   The Google Interactive Media Ads SDK and Google Programmatic Access Library are not allowed for Interstitial or Standalone placements, unless through an official Google Beta program or [for placements in CTV inventory](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/16127271).

#### Protect advertiser value

4.  Video inventory controls (for example, play, pause, mute, skip, or dismiss), and ad content or controls where provided, must not be obstructed, hidden, or non-functional.
    *   For clarity, video inventory controls or ad controls that are activated or displayed only as a result of a single user action (for example, scrolling, hovering over, tapping or swiping the screen) are not considered as obstructed, hidden, or non-functional.
5.  For In-stream placements, audio ads must not be requested or served in muted placements.

#### Respect the user

6.  Video inventory may autoplay, provided that:
    *   Only one video inventory across all placement types may autoplay with sound at any time.
        *   Additionally for In-stream or Accompanying Content placements, only one video player may autoplay in view at any time.
    *   The ad must not autoplay until at least 50% of the ad unit is visible.
7.  Except Connected TV and Digital out-of-home inventory where sticky placements are not supported, other types of video inventory may be sticky, provided that:
    *   A dismiss option is presented for the entire duration of the video or ad content. This option must not be hidden, obstructed, or non-functional.
    *   For In-stream or Accompanying Content placements that transition to a sticky placement, the video player must start in the main content and only transition as a user scrolls the video player off the page.

#### Additional requirements for Connected TV and Digital out-of-home

8.  In addition to the above, Connected TV and Digital out-of-home inventory must comply with the [Requirements for Connected TV and Digital out-of-home inventory](about:/admanager/answer/16127271#definitions).

[Next: Remove a site from your AdSense sites list](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/12169215?hl=en&ref_topic=12129816)

To monetize a site with AdSense, you should have unique and valuable content and provide a good user experience. Explore our tips here.

Provide enough unique content
-----------------------------

For your site to be ready to show AdSense ads, make sure that your pages have enough unique content so that we can determine what your site is about. You should provide content that gives your users a reason to visit and return to your site.

[Google AdSense Quality content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poU80MgSvrY)

For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon ![Image of YouTube settings icon](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/UrHzzlx74G5ig5vYXo9Nk43r7NM5fj72Tbu1) at the bottom of the video player, then select "Subtitles/CC" and choose your language.

* * *

When you create content, it’s important to ask yourself if it provides substantial value and originality when compared to other sites covering similar subjects, as this will attract more visitors to your site. Tools such as [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) can give you a feel for what people are interested in so you can tailor your content. [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) includes many free-of-charge tools that can help you to build a more complete picture of your users and identify areas where you could improve your content marketing. For more information, visit our AdSense blog post on [creating outstanding website content in 3 steps](https://blog.google/products/adsense/creating-outstanding-website-content-3-steps/).

Additionally, make sure that you update your site regularly. Continually adding new and unique content will keep your site fresh and generate more returning visitors.

Also, don't forget to make sure that your content adheres to the [Spam policies for Google web search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies). The [Spam policies for Google web search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies) recommend that you do not use [cloaking](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66355) and [doorway pages](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721311), pages with little to no content, or pages optimized for specific keywords or phrases.

Make certain that there’s no duplicate content
----------------------------------------------

As stated in the [Google Publisher Policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9335564), Google ads may not be placed on sites with [scraped or copyrighted content](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721312). Some examples of scraping sites include:

*   Sites that copy and republish content from other sites without adding any original content or value
*   Sites that copy content from other sites, modify it slightly (for example, by substituting synonyms or using [automated techniques](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721306)), and republish it
*   Sites dedicated to embedding content such as video, images, or other media from other sites without substantial added value to the user

Be careful when using external resources such as external articles or embedded videos. It's important that you contribute your own original content, whether it's specialist knowledge, improvement ideas, reviews, or your personal thoughts. Check that the content on your site is unique and that fragments are not copied from other sites. Also ensure that the same content is not duplicated in the same page or across multiple pages of your site.

If you have many pages that are similar or have very similar content, consider expanding each page or consolidating the pages into one. Also, try to minimize repeating long segments of text in different pages of your site, for example, instead of including lengthy copyright text on the bottom of every page, include a very brief summary and then link to a page with more details. You can use the [Parameter Handling tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710) to specify how you would like Google to treat URL parameters.

For more tips, review our guide on how to [avoid creating duplicate content](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359).

Build a good user experience with navigational elements
-------------------------------------------------------

Providing original content is only one component of creating a high-quality site. Your content should also be informative and organized in a manner that's easy for users to navigate. Consider the arrangement of the elements (text, images, etc.) on your pages. Your layout should look inviting and visitors should be able to easily find what they're looking for.

[Google AdSense Navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_xKMJ8m6nY)

For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon ![Image of YouTube settings icon](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/UrHzzlx74G5ig5vYXo9Nk43r7NM5fj72Tbu1) at the bottom of the video player, then select "Subtitles/CC" and choose your language.

* * *

An accessible, easy-to-use navigation bar (or menu bar) is a key part of providing a good user experience. When building your navigation bar, consider the following points:

*   **Alignment** - Are all the navigational elements lined up correctly across all devices?
*   **Readability** - Is the text content on your site easy to read?
*   **Functionality** - Do your drop-down lists work correctly? Are all navigational elements clickable?
*   **Accuracy** - Are the elements bringing the user to the right content?

After you've added unique content to your site, don’t forget to organize it. We recommend that you structure and organize your content as follows:

*   Add navigational elements to the menu bar and organize your content by topic, category, etc. This will help users to better understand and navigate your site.
*   Avoid repeating the same content in multiple categories or pages of your site or creating multiple pages or sites with content taken from other sources.
*   Make sure that your site provides the information and service promised and does not have links that lead to:
    *   False claims of downloadable or streaming content
    *   Missing pages
    *   Irrelevant or misleading pages
    *   Text on a page not related to the theme or business model of the site
*   Ensure that your site [appears correctly in different browsers](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/100782).

We recommend visiting our AdSense blog post on [refining your website’s user experience in 3 steps](https://blog.google/products/adsense/refining-your-websites-user-experience-in-3-steps/).

Submit your site for review
---------------------------

Lastly, don’t forget to review the [AdSense Program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182) to ensure that the content on your site is compliant with our policies.

Building a high-quality site takes effort and time. When you’ve addressed the above points, [submit your site for review](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9130038) through the **Sites** page in your AdSense account. The review process usually takes a few days and you’ll be notified about the review results through your AdSense account.

# Manual actions report - Search Console Help
 See if your site has any manual actions issued against it and view the site's manual action history.

**If a site has a manual action, some or all of that site will not be shown in Google search results.**

[Open the Manual actions report](https://search.google.com/search-console/manual-actions?utm_source=support.google.com/webmasters/&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=9044175)

[Manual Actions report in Search Console - Google Search Console Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AR-pU_1SuI)

What is a manual action?
------------------------

Google issues a manual action against a site when a human reviewer at Google has determined that pages on the site are not compliant with [Google's spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies). Most manual actions address attempts to manipulate our search index. Most issues reported here will result in pages or sites being ranked lower or omitted from search results without any visual indication to the user.

If your site is affected by a manual action, we will notify you in the Manual Actions report and in the Search Console message center.

**Why do manual actions exist?**

Ever since there have been search engines, there have been people dedicated to tricking their way to the top of the results page. This is bad for searchers because more relevant pages get buried under irrelevant results, and it's bad for legitimate websites because these sites become harder to find. For these reasons, we've been working since the earliest days of Google to fight spammers, helping people find the answers they're looking for, and helping legitimate websites get traffic from search.

Google is constantly working to improve search. We take a data-driven approach and employ analysts, researchers, and statisticians to evaluate search quality on a full-time basis. Changes to our algorithms undergo extensive quality evaluation before being released. [More information about our algorithm.](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/)

Our algorithms are extremely good at detecting spam, and in most cases we automatically discover it and remove it from our search results. However, to protect the quality of our index, we're also willing to take manual action to remove spam from our search results.

Do I have any manual actions against my site?
---------------------------------------------

You'll see a count of manual actions against your site at the top of the report. If your site has no manual actions, you'll see a green check mark and an appropriate message.

**But I just bought this site!**

If you recently bought a site that violated our spam policies before you owned it, fix the issues listed in this report, then let us know in your reconsideration request that you recently acquired the site and that it now no longer violates the policies.

What pages are affected?
------------------------

Expand the manual action description to see a list of patterns of affected pages. This can be a subset of your site, or the entire site. Not all of the pages matching the pattern are necessarily affected.

**Example:**

*   `https://example.com/real-estate/*` – some or all pages under the `real-estate/` directory are affected.
*   **Affects all pages** – Manual actions with this description affect the entire site.

How do I fix the problem?
-------------------------

**To fix a manual action on your site:**

1.  Expand the manual action description panel on the report for more information.
2.  See which pages are affected.
3.  See the type and short description of the issue, and follow the "Learn more" link to see detailed information and steps to fix the issue. (You can find the detailed information for each action below on this page).
4.  Fix the issue on _all affected pages_**.** Fixing the issue on just some pages will not earn you a partial return to search results. If you have multiple manual actions on your site, read about and fix all of them.
5.  Be sure that Google can reach your pages; affected pages should not require a login, be behind a paywall, or be blocked by [robots.txt](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/12818275) or a noindex directive. You can test accessibility by using the [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289).
6.  When **all issues** listed in the report are fixed in **all pages**, select **Request Review** in this report. In your reconsideration request, describe your fixes. A good request does three things:
    *   Explains the exact quality issue on your site.
    *   Describes the steps you've taken to fix the issue.
    *   Documents the outcome of your efforts.
7.  Reconsideration reviews can take some time ([see below)](#reconsideration-timeline). You will be informed of progress by email. You will get a review confirmation message when you send your request, to inform you that the review is in progress; don't resubmit your request before you get a final decision on your outstanding request.

How long will my reconsideration review take?
---------------------------------------------

Most reconsideration reviews can take several days or weeks, although in some cases, such as link-related reconsideration requests, it may take longer than usual to review your request. You will be informed by email when we receive your request, so you'll know it is active. You will also receive an email when the review is complete. Please don't resubmit your request before you get a decision on any outstanding requests.

List of manual actions
----------------------

Here are the manual actions that can be applied by Google and how to fix them.

Site abused with third-party spam

Google has detected a significant portion of your site being abused with spam that violates Google's spam policies and adds little or no value to the web. The spammy content may appear on your forums, guestbooks, social media platforms, file uploader, free hosting services, or internal search pages.

This spammy content is possibly generated by site visitors or other third-parties, and it leverages your site to promote spam rather than the actual subject matter of your site.

If you receive a notification from Google about this type of spam, the good news is that we generally believe your site is of sufficient quality that we didn't see a need to take manual action on the whole site. This manual action will only affect those pages with spammy content. However, if your site has too much spammy content like this, that may affect our overall assessment of the site, result in a bad user experience, and affect your site's reputation and ranking.

### Recommended actions

Review Google's Spam policies on [user-generated spam](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#user-generated-spam), documentation on preventing [comment spam](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/81749) and [free host spam](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/free-web-hosters), and [how to fix hacked pages](https://web.dev/explore/secure#help!-i've-been-hacked), then follow these steps to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

1.  Identify pages on your site where users, visitors, or other third-parties could add content or interact with: these could be your forums, guestbooks, social media platforms, file uploader, free hosting services, or internal search pages that users can send queries to.
2.  Review the example URLs in the messages you received in the Search Console Messages center or by email to gain a better sense of where the spammy content appears. In addition, please search your site for unexpected or spammy content using the ["site:" operator](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/search-operators/all-search-site) in Google search, adding commercial or adult keywords that are unrelated to your site's topic. For example, search for \[site:_your-domain-name_ viagra\] or \[site:_your-domain-name_ free movie watch online\] to detect the irrelevant content on your site. Search for things such as:
    *   Out-of-context text or off-topic links with the sole purpose of promoting a third-party website or service (for example, "Free movie download" or "watch online”)
    *   Gibberish or text that appears to be auto-generated
    *   Comments or information submitted by users with unrealistic, commercial-sounding keywords; that is, user names like "Discount Insurance" that don't sound like real usernames and link to unrelated sites
    *   Internal search results where the user's query appears geared at promoting a third-party website or service
3.  Monitor your web server log files for sudden unexpected or unexplained traffic spikes, especially for newly created pages. Look for any URLs with keywords in URL patterns that are completely irrelevant to your website. You can see your top clicked pages in Google Search by using the [Performance report for Search](https://search.google.com/search-console/performance/search-analytics).
4.  Remove any inappropriate content and block obviously inappropriate third-party content from being published to your platform with a list of spammy terms (such as streaming, download, adult, gambling, or pharma terms).
5.  Where appropriate, use these guides:
    *   [Prevent user-generated spam on your site](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/prevent-abuse)
    *   [Marking user-generated content links with rel=”ugc”](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/qualify-outbound-links)
    *   [Fixing hacked pages](https://web.dev/explore/secure#help!-i've-been-hacked)
6.  Consider consolidating your interactive content into a concentrated file path for easier maintenance and spam detection.
7.  When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
8.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.
9.  In the meanwhile, it is also recommended to continue actively monitoring and cleaning up such spammy content, improve your site's system and fix system vulnerability to prevent such spam in the future.

User-generated spam

Google has detected spam on your pages submitted by site visitors. Typically, this kind of spam is found on forum pages, guestbook pages, or in user profiles.

[Matt Cutts explains the "User-Generated Spam" manual action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjmXYBQZQ8Q)

### Recommended actions

Review the Google's policies on [user-generated spam](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721437), then follow these steps to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

1.  Users commonly add content to sites in forums, blog comments, and user profiles. Identify pages on your site where users could have added content.
2.  Look for profiles with commercial usernames like "Discount Insurance” or posts with advertisements, off-topic links, or gibberish text. Check these areas for the following:
    *   Posts or profiles that look like advertisements
    *   Posts or profiles with out-of-context or off-topic links
    *   Posts or profiles with commercial usernames — names like "Discount Insurance," that don't sound like real human names — that link to unrelated sites
    *   Posts or profiles that appear to be automatically generated (not written by a real user)
3.  Search your site for unexpected or spammy content using the `site:` operator in Google search, adding commercial or adult keywords that are unrelated to your site's topic. For example, search for \[site:example.com viagra\] to search for the term "viagra" on your site.
4.  Remove any inappropriate content.
5.  Consider [implementing measures to prevent user-generated spam](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/prevent-abuse).
6.  When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
7.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

Spammy free host

A significant fraction of sites hosted on your free web hosting service are spammy.

Google tries to be precise when taking manual action related to spam. However, if a significant fraction of the pages on a given web hosting service are spammy, we may take manual action on the whole service.

### Recommended actions

1.  [Get tips for preventing and identifying abuse of your service.](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/prevent-abuse)
2.  Remove any existing spammy accounts from your service.
3.  Contact the technical team at your hosting service and tell them about the manual action.
4.  When you're satisfied that your site follows our spam policies, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
5.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

Structured data issue

Google has detected that some of the markup on your pages may be using techniques that are outside our [structured data guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/sd-policies), for example: marking up content that is invisible to users, marking up irrelevant or misleading content, or other manipulative behavior.

### Recommended actions

1.  Make sure that the markup on your site meets Google's [structured data guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/sd-policies) if you would like it featured in Google search results. This might require updating existing markup or removing any markup that violates our guidelines.
2.  When you've made these changes, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
3.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our guidelines, we'll revoke the manual action.

Unnatural links **_to_** your site

Google has detected a pattern of unnatural, artificial, deceptive, or manipulative links pointing to your site. [Buying links or participating in link schemes](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356) in order to manipulate ranking in Google Search results is a violation of our spam policies. This can result in some or all of your site getting a manual action.

[Matt Cutts and Alex explain the "Unnatural links to your site" manual action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UFHCw4Q_FQ)

### Recommended actions

First, review [Google's link spam policy](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#link-spam).

Next, follow the steps below to identify and correct the violation(s):

1.  Download a list of [links to your site](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9049606) from Search Console. You can download your links arranged either by hostname (**[Top linking sites](https://search.google.com/search-console/links/drilldown) > Export**) or in chronological order ([Links report](https://search.google.com/search-console/links) > **Export external links > Latest links**).
2.  Check this list for any links that violate our link spam policy. If the list is large, start by looking at the sites that link to you the most, or links that were created recently (in the last few months).
3.  For any links that violate our spam policies, [contact the owner](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9109) of that site and ask that they either remove the links or prevent them from passing PageRank, such as by adding a [rel=”nofollow”](96569) or a more specific attribute.
4.  Use the [Disavow links tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487) in Search Console to disavow any links that you could not get removed. We often see the Disavow links tool used incorrectly so **keep the following things in mind when using the tool**:
    *   If you can get a backlink removed, make a good-faith effort to remove the link first. Blindly adding all backlinks to the disavow file is not considered a good-faith effort, and will not be enough to make your reconsideration request successful.
    *   For multiple links from the same domain to your site, use the "domain:" operator in the disavow file for convenience.
    *   Make sure that you don't disavow organic links to your site.
    *   Simply disavowing all backlinks without attempting to remove them might lead to rejection of your request.
5.  When you've removed or disavowed the artificial links, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report. Include documentation about the links you've had removed and an explanation of any links you were unable to remove, to help us process your request.
6.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

Unnatural links _**from**_ your site

Google has detected a pattern of unnatural artificial, deceptive, or manipulative outbound links on your site. [Buying links or participating in link schemes](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356) in order to manipulate ranking in Google Search results is a violation of Google's spam policies.

[Matt Cutts and Sandy discuss the "Unnatural links from your site" manual action.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mdMXdQ_VyU)

### Recommended actions

First, review [Google's link spam policy](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#link-spam).

Next, follow the steps below to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

1.  Identify any links on your site that were paid for or that appear to violate our link spam policy, such as [excessive link exchanges](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#link-spam).
2.  Either remove these links, or change them so that they no longer pass PageRank, for example by adding a [rel=”nofollow”](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569) or a more specific attribute, or by redirecting them through a page [blocked by robots.txt](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608).
3.  When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report. Provide examples of bad content that you removed and good content that you added.
4.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

Thin content with little or no added value

Google has detected low-quality pages or shallow pages on your site. Here are a few common examples of pages that often have thin content with little or no added value:

*   Thin affiliate pages
*   Content from other sources. For example: scraped content or low-quality guest blog posts
*   Doorways

These techniques don't provide users with substantially unique or valuable content, and are in violation of our [spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies).

[Matt Cutts explains the "Thin Content with little or no added value" manual action.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3-obcXkyA4)

### Recommended actions

First, review the following sections of our spam policies:

*   [Thin affiliate pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#thin-affiliate-pages)
*   [Scraped content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#scraped-content)
*   [Doorways](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#doorways)

Next, follow the steps below to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

1.  Check for content on your site that duplicates content found elsewhere.
2.  Check for thin content pages with affiliate links on your site.
3.  Check for doorway pages on your site.
4.  If your site contains any of these types of content, think about whether your site [provides significant added value for your users](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content).   
    _Tip: Consider asking friends or family — real people not affiliated with your site — to use or critique your site to get ideas for improving it._
5.  Improve your website so that it provides significant value for your users.
6.  When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report. Provide examples of bad content that you removed and good content that you added.
7.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

Cloaking and/or sneaky redirects

Your site may be showing different pages to users than are shown to Google, or redirecting users to a different page than Google saw. [Cloaking and sneaky redirects](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66355) are a violation of Google's spam policies.

[Matt Cutts explains cloaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHtnfOgp65Q)

**Subscription and paywalled content:** Publishers should [enclose paywalled content with structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/paywalled-content) in order to help Google differentiate paywalled content from the practice of [cloaking](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66355), where the content served to Googlebot is different from the content served to users.

### Recommended actions

First, review Google's spam policies on [cloaking](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#cloaking) and [sneaky redirects](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#sneaky-redirects).

Next, follow the steps below to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

1.  Use the [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) in Search Console to fetch pages from the affected area of your site.
2.  Compare the content fetched by Google to the content seen by a human user (you!) when visiting the site.
3.  If the content differs, identify and remove the part of your site that's serving different content to Google and users. This will require looking through your site's code on the server.
4.  Check for URLs on your site that redirect users to somewhere other than where they expected to go.
5.  Check for URLs on your site that redirect conditionally, for example that redirect only users coming from Google search, or only users coming from a particular range of IP addresses.
6.  If your site redirects users in any of these ways, identify and remove the part of your site that generates these redirects. This will require looking through your site's code on the server.  
    _Tip: These types of redirects are often written in JavaScript or in your .htaccess file. You might also check your content management system and any plugins._
7.  When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
8.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

Major spam problems

The site appears to use aggressive spam techniques such as [scaled content abuse](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#scaled-content), [cloaking](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#cloaking), and/or other repeated or egregious violations of [Google's spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies).

### Recommended actions

1.  Update your site so that it no longer violates [Google's spam policies](about:/webmasters/answer/35769#quality_guidelines).
2.  When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report. Provide examples of bad content that you removed and good content that you added.
3.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

Cloaked images

Some of your site's images may display differently in Google's search results than when viewed on your site. [_Cloaking_](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#cloaking) is the practice of presenting different content to human users than to search engines. Cloaking is considered a violation of [Google's spam policies](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769) because it provides our users with different results than they expected. Cloaking images can provide a bad user experience for Google image search results, as obscured images and mismatched thumbnails do not present the user with the image that they are searching for.

**Examples of cloaked images**

Here are some examples of image cloaking behavior:

*   Serving images to Google that are obscured by another image, for example: a block of text blocking an image.
*   Serving images to Google that are different than the image served to a page visitor.

**If you need to block images from Google search results**, use the method [described below](#block-image-search-results).

### Recommended actions

1.  Ensure that your site displays exactly the same images to users on your site and in Google search results. Cloaking is acceptable only for opting out of image search inline linking as detailed below.
2.  When you're sure that your site's images are exactly the same whether viewed directly on your site or from Google search results, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
3.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account; we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

**Minimize or block an image in search results**

*   To prevent the **full-sized image** from appearing in the Google search results, **opt out of inline linking**.
*   To **prevent the image from appearing at all** in search results, [follow these steps](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35308).

**To opt out of inline linking:**

1.  When your image is requested, examine the [HTTP referrer header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) in the request.
2.  If the request is coming from [a Google domain](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/80553), reply with HTTP 200 or 204 and no content.

Google will still crawl your page and see the image, but will display a thumbnail image generated at crawl time in search results. This opt-out is possible at any time, and does not require re-processing of a website's images. This behavior is not considered image cloaking and will not result in a manual action.

Hidden text and/or keyword stuffing

Some of your pages may contain [hidden text](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#hidden-text-and-links) or [keyword stuffing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#keyword-stuffing), techniques that are not allowed by [Google's spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies).

[Matt Cutts and Nelson explain what it means if your site has a manual action labeled as "Hidden text and/or keyword stuffing" and what you can do to fix it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y-m_jiayLQ)

### Recommended actions

First, review Google's spam policies on [hidden text](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#hidden-text-and-links) and [keyword stuffing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#keyword-stuffing).

Next, follow the steps below to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

1.  Use the [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) in Search Console to check for content that's visible to our crawler but isn't visible to a human user (you!) when visiting the site.
2.  Check for text that's the same, or similar, color as the background of the webpage.  
    _Tip: You can often reveal such text by selecting all the text on the page, for example by pressing Ctrl + A or Command + A._
3.  Check for any text hidden using CSS styling or positioning.
4.  Remove or re-style any hidden text so that it's equally discoverable by search engine crawlers and by human users.
5.  Check for lists or paragraphs of repeated words without any context.
6.  Check `<title>` tags and alt text for strings of repeated words.
7.  Remove any such words or other instances of keyword stuffing.
8.  When you're sure your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
9.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

AMP content mismatch

There is a difference in content between the AMP version and its canonical web page.

The content of the AMP version and its canonical web page should be essentially the same. The text need not be identical, but the topic should be the same, and users should be able to accomplish the same tasks on both the AMP and the canonical page.

AMP pages affected by this manual action will not be shown in Google Search: the canonical page will be shown instead.

### Recommended actions

1.  Ensure that the AMP is referencing the correct canonical web page.
2.  Ensure that the general content of the AMP and canonical page are the same.
3.  Check that Google's view of the page is not different from the user's view of the page by using the [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) for both the AMP and the canonical page. A mismatch can occur when a robots.txt file blocks significant resources on one or the other. Blocked resources will also be shown in the URL Inspection tool.
4.  When your AMP and canonical pages are essentially the same, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
5.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

Sneaky mobile redirects

Some pages on this site appear to be redirecting mobile device users to content not available to search engine crawlers. These sneaky redirects are a violation of [Google spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies). To ensure quality search results for our users, the Google Search Quality team can take action on such sites, including removal of URLs from our index.

### Overview

In many cases, it is okay to show slightly different content on different devices. For example, optimizing for the smaller space of a smartphone screen can mean that some content, like images, need to be modified. Similarly, for mobile-only redirects, redirecting mobile users to improve their mobile experience (like redirecting mobile users from example.com/url1 to m.example.com/url1) is often beneficial to them. However, redirecting mobile users sneakily to different content is bad for the user experience.

![Sneaky Mobile Redirect](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B8Yz-lAMpqt4GT8cy9Dm2S5gTxfN_si08fVoMastpC511uFrJJr57MuHl-KJXwnsG6E=w895)

**A frustrating experience:** The same URL shows up in search result pages on desktop and on mobile. However, when a user clicks on this result on their desktop computer, they visit URL A, but users clicking on the same result on a smartphone are redirected to unrelated URL B.

Sneaky mobile redirects can be created intentionally by a site owner, but we've also seen situations where mobile-only sneaky redirects happen without the site owner's knowledge. The following are examples of configurations that can cause sneaky mobile redirects:

*   Adding code that creates redirection rules for mobile users
*   Using a script or element to display ads and monetize content that redirect mobile users
*   A script or element added by hackers that redirects your mobile users to malicious sites

### Recommended actions

1.  **If you are not engaging in this behavior intentionally:**
    1.  **Make sure that your site is not hacked**
        
        Check the [Security Issues report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044101) to see if Google thinks you have been hacked.
        
    2.  **Audit third-party scripts/elements on your site**
        
        If your site is not hacked, then we recommend that you take the time to investigate if third-party scripts or elements are causing the redirects. You can follow these steps:
        
        1.  Remove any third-party scripts or elements you do not control from the redirecting page(s) one by one.
        2.  After removing each script or element, check your site behavior on a mobile device or in [Chrome mobile emulator](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) (or any other emulator) to see if the redirection stops.
        3.  If you think a particular script or element is responsible for the sneaky redirect, consider removing it from your site and possibly debugging the issue with the script or element provider.
2.  **If you are engaging in this behavior intentionally:**  
    Fix your pages.
3.  **Confirm your fix** by visiting your pages from Google search results with a smartphone or in a mobile device emulator.
4.  When the issue is fixed on all pages in your site, select [**Request Review**](#request-review) on the Manual Actions report.
5.  After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

### Avoiding sneaky mobile redirects in the future

To diminish the risk of unknowingly redirecting your own users, be sure to choose advertisers who are transparent on how they handle user traffic. If you are interested in building trust in the online advertising space, you should research industry-wide best practices when participating in ad networks. For example, the Trustworthy Accountability Group's (Interactive Advertising Bureau) [Inventory Quality Guidelines](http://www.tagtoday.net/iqg/) are a good place to start. There are many ways to monetize your content with mobile solutions that provide a high quality user experience. Be sure to use them.

To check for sneaky mobile redirects on your site, walk through the following steps:

1.  **Check if you are redirected when you navigate to your site on your smartphone**
    
    We recommend you check the mobile user experience of your site by visiting your pages from Google search results with a smartphone. When debugging, mobile emulation in desktop browsers is handy because you can test for many different devices. You can, for example, view pages as a mobile device straight from your browser in Chrome, Firefox or Safari (for the latter, make sure you have enabled the "Show Develop menu in menu bar” feature).
    
2.  **Listen to your users**
    
    Your users can see your site in different ways than you. It's always important to pay attention to user complaints, so you can hear of any issue related to the mobile user experience.
    
3.  **Monitor your mobile users in your site's analytics data**
    
    Unusual mobile user activity can be detected by looking at some of the data in your website's analytics data. For example, keep an eye on the average time spent on your site by your mobile users: if all of a sudden, only your mobile users start spending much less time on your site than they used to, there might be an issue related to mobile redirections.
    
    Monitoring for any large changes in your mobile user activity can help you proactively identify sneaky mobile redirects. You can [set up Google Analytics alerts](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033021#create) that will warn you of sharp drops in average time spent on your site by mobile users or drops in mobile users. While these alerts do not necessarily mean that you have mobile sneaky redirects, it's something worth investigating.

Site reputation abuse
---------------------

Google has detected that a portion of your site is violating our spam policy on [site reputation abuse](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#site-reputation).

The current manual action affects pages with content that violates our policy. However, if your site repeatedly violates our site reputation abuse policy, that may lead to further manual actions and/or affect your site’s overall ranking.

**Recommended actions:**

Review Google’s [spam policy on site reputation abuse](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#site-reputation), then follow these steps to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

1.  Look for any third-party content on your site that violates the [site reputation abuse policy](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#site-reputation). To get a better sense of where the violating content appears, review the list of patterns of affected pages in the message you received from Search Console (either in the Search Console Messages center, Manual Actions report, or by email).
2.  Decide what to do with the violating content and take action. For example:
    
    *   **Move the violating content to a new domain.** If you link from the old site to the new site, use the [`nofollow` attribute](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/qualify-outbound-links) in those links. Avoid [redirecting URLs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/301-redirects) from the old site to the new site, as redirecting may introduce the site reputation abuse issue again.
        
    *   **Use** [**`noindex`** to exclude the violating content from Search indexing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/block-indexing). To make sure your noindex rule is effective, don't block that content with your robots.txt file.
        
    *   **Redo the violating conten**t as first-party content.
        
    *   **Remove the violating content** from your site.
        
        **Caution**: Moving the content to another established site or to a subdomain/subdirectory within your site may not resolve the underlying issue:
        
        *   **Moving to a subdomain/subdirectory** may be viewed as an [attempt to circumvent](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#policy-circumvension) our spam policy, which could lead to broader actions against your site in Google Search. 
        *   **Moving to an established site** may introduce a site reputation abuse issue to the established site if that site has its own reputation and the third-party nature is unchanged.
        
3.  When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select “Request Review” on the [Manual Actions report](https://search.google.com/search-console/manual-actions).
4.  After you’ve submitted a reconsideration request, look for review status messages in your Search Console account — we’ll let you know when we’ve reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we’ll revoke the manual action. 

### What's the difference between the Manual Actions report and the Security Issues report?

There is some conceptual overlap between the Manual Actions report and the Security Issues report, so it is useful to know the difference between them:

**The Manual Actions report** lists manually detected issues with a page or site that are mostly attempts to manipulate our search index, but are not necessarily dangerous for users. Most issues reported here will result in pages or site being ranked lower or omitted from search results without any visual indication to the user.

**The Security Issues report** lists indications that your site was hacked, or behavior on your site that could potentially harm a visitor or their computer: for example, phishing attacks or installing malware or unwanted software on the user's computer. These pages can appear with a warning label in search results, or a browser can display an interstitial warning page when a user tries to visit them.

# Spam Policies for Google Web Search | Google Search Central  |  Documentation  |  Google for Developers
In the context of Google Search, spam refers to techniques used to deceive users or manipulate our Search systems into ranking content highly. Our spam policies help protect users and improve the quality of Search results. To be eligible to appear in Google web search results (web pages, images, videos, news content or other material that Google finds from across the web), content shouldn't violate [Google Search's overall policies](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10622781) or the spam policies listed on this page. These policies apply to all web search results, including those from Google's own properties.

We detect policy-violating practices both through automated systems and, as needed, human review that can result in a [manual action](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175). Sites that violate our policies may rank lower in results or not appear in results at all.

If you believe that a site is violating Google's spam policies, let us know by [filing a search quality user report](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/report-spam). We're focused on developing scalable and automated solutions to problems, and we'll use these reports to further improve our spam detection systems.

Our policies cover common spam practices, but Google may act against any type of spam practices we detect.

Cloaking
--------

Cloaking refers to the practice of presenting different content to users and search engines with the intent to manipulate search rankings and mislead users. Examples of cloaking include:

*   Showing a page about travel destinations to search engines while showing a page about discount drugs to users
*   Inserting text or keywords into a page only when the user agent that is requesting the page is a search engine, not a human visitor

If your site uses technologies that search engines have difficulty accessing, like [JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics) or [images](about:/search/docs/appearance/google-images#help-us-discover-all-your-images), see our recommendations for making that content accessible to search engines and users without cloaking.

If a site is hacked, it's not uncommon for the hacker to use cloaking to make the hack harder for the site owner to detect. Read more about [fixing hacked sites](https://web.dev/articles/hacked) and avoiding being hacked.

If you operate a paywall or a content-gating mechanism, we don't consider this to be cloaking if Google can see the full content of what's behind the paywall just like any person who has access to the gated material and if you follow our [Flexible Sampling general guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/flexible-sampling).

Doorway abuse
-------------

Doorway abuse is when sites or pages are created to rank for specific, similar search queries. They lead users to intermediate pages that are not as useful as the final destination. Examples of doorway abuse include:

*   Having multiple websites with slight variations to the URL and home page to maximize their reach for any specific query
*   Having multiple domain names or pages targeted at specific regions or cities that funnel users to one page
*   Generating pages to funnel visitors into the actual usable or relevant portion of a site
*   Creating substantially similar pages that are closer to search results than a clearly defined, browseable hierarchy

Expired domain abuse
--------------------

Expired domain abuse is where an expired domain name is purchased and repurposed primarily to manipulate search rankings by hosting content that provides little to no value to users. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to:

*   Affiliate content on a site previously used by a government agency
*   Commercial medical products being sold on a site previously used by a non-profit medical charity
*   Casino-related content on a former elementary school site

Hacked content
--------------

Hacked content is any content placed on a site without permission, due to vulnerabilities in a site's security. Hacked content gives poor search results to our users and can potentially install malicious content on their machines. Examples of hacking include:

*   **Code injection**: When hackers gain access to your website, they might try to inject malicious code into existing pages on your site. This often takes the form of malicious JavaScript injected directly into the site, or into iframes.
*   **Page injection**: Sometimes, due to security flaws, hackers are able to add new pages to your site that contain spammy or malicious content. These pages are often meant to manipulate search engines or to [attempt phishing](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106318). Your existing pages might not show signs of hacking, but these newly-created pages could harm your site's visitors or your site's performance in search results.
*   **Content injection**: Hackers might also try to subtly manipulate existing pages on your site. Their goal is to add content to your site that search engines can see but which may be harder for you and your users to spot. This can involve adding [hidden links or hidden text](#hidden-text-and-links) to a page by using CSS or HTML, or it can involve more complex changes like [cloaking](#cloaking).
*   **Redirects**: Hackers might inject malicious code to your website that redirects some users to harmful or spammy pages. The kind of redirect sometimes depends on the referrer, user agent, or device. For example, clicking a URL in Google Search results could redirect you to a suspicious page, but there is no redirect when you visit the same URL directly from a browser.

Here are our tips on [fixing hacked sites](https://web.dev/articles/hacked) and avoiding being hacked.

Hidden text and link abuse
--------------------------

Hidden text or link abuse is the practice of placing content on a page in a way solely to manipulate search engines and not to be easily viewable by human visitors. Examples of hidden text or link abuse include:

*   Using white text on a white background
*   Hiding text behind an image
*   Using CSS to position text off-screen
*   Setting the font size or opacity to 0
*   Hiding a link by only linking one small character (for example, a hyphen in the middle of a paragraph)

There are many web design elements today that utilize showing and hiding content in a dynamic way to improve user experience; these elements don't violate our policies:

*   Accordion or tabbed content that toggle between hiding and showing additional content
*   Slideshow or slider that cycles between several images or text paragraphs
*   Tooltip or similar text that displays additional content when users interact with over an element
*   Text that's only accessible to screen readers and is intended to improve the experience for those using screen readers

Keyword stuffing
----------------

Keyword stuffing refers to the practice of filling a web page with keywords or numbers in an attempt to manipulate rankings in Google Search results. Often these keywords appear in a list or group, unnaturally, or out of context. Examples of keyword stuffing include:

*   Lists of phone numbers without substantial added value
*   Blocks of text that list cities and regions that a web page is trying to rank for
*   Repeating the same words or phrases so often that it sounds unnatural. For example:
    
    > Unlimited app store credit. There are so many sites that claim to offer app store credit for $0 but they're all fake and always mess up with users looking for unlimited app store credits. You can get limitless credits for app store right here on this website. Visit our unlimited app store credit page and get it today!
    

Link spam
---------

Link spam is the practice of creating links to or from a site primarily for the purpose of manipulating search rankings. The following are examples of link spam:

*   Buying or selling links for ranking purposes. This includes:
    *   Exchanging money for links, or posts that contain links
    *   Exchanging goods or services for links
    *   Sending someone a product in exchange for them writing about it and including a link
*   Excessive link exchanges ("Link to me and I'll link to you") or partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking
*   Using automated programs or services to create links to your site
*   Requiring a link as part of a Terms of Service, contract, or similar arrangement without allowing a third-party content owner the choice of [qualifying the outbound link](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/qualify-outbound-links)
*   Text advertisements or text links that don't block ranking credit
*   Advertorials or native advertising where payment is received for articles that include links that pass ranking credit, or links with optimized anchor text in articles, guest posts, or press releases distributed on other sites. For example:
    
    > There are many [wedding rings](https://www.example.com/) on the market. If you want to have a [wedding](https://www.example.com/), you will have to pick the [best ring](https://www.example.com/). You will also need to [buy flowers](https://www.example.com/) and a [wedding dress](https://www.example.com/).
    
*   Low-quality directory or bookmark site links
*   Keyword-rich, hidden, or low-quality links embedded in widgets that are distributed across various sites
*   Widely distributed links in the footers or templates of various sites
*   Forum comments with optimized links in the post or signature, for example:
    
    > Thanks, that's great info!  
    > \- Paul  
    > [paul's pizza](https://www.example.com/) [san diego pizza](https://www.example.com/) [best pizza san diego](https://www.example.com/)
    
*   Creating low-value content primarily for the purposes of manipulating linking and ranking signals

Google does understand that buying and selling links is a normal part of the economy of the web for advertising and sponsorship purposes. It's not a violation of our policies to have such links as long as they are [qualified](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/qualify-outbound-links) with a [`rel="nofollow"`](about:/search/docs/crawling-indexing/qualify-outbound-links#nofollow) or [`rel="sponsored"`](about:/search/docs/crawling-indexing/qualify-outbound-links#sponsored) attribute value to the `<a>` tag.

Machine-generated traffic
-------------------------

Machine-generated traffic (also called [automated traffic](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/86640)) refers to the practice of sending automated queries to Google. This includes scraping results for rank-checking purposes or other types of automated access to Google Search conducted without express permission. Machine-generated traffic consumes resources and interferes with our ability to best serve users. Such activities violate our spam policies and the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

Malware and malicious practices
-------------------------------

Google checks to see whether websites host malware or unwanted software that negatively affects the user experience.

[Malware](about:/search/docs/monitor-debug/security/malware#what_is_malware) is any software or mobile application specifically designed to harm a computer, a mobile device, the software it's running, or its users. Malware exhibits malicious behavior that can include installing software without user consent and installing harmful software such as viruses. Site owners sometimes don't realize that their downloadable files are considered malware, so these binaries might be hosted inadvertently.

[Unwanted software](about:/search/docs/monitor-debug/security/malware#what-is-unwanted-software) is an executable file or mobile application that engages in behavior that is deceptive, unexpected, or that negatively affects the user's browsing or computing experience. Examples include software that switches your home page or other browser settings to ones you don't want, or apps that leak private and personal information without proper disclosure.

Site owners should make sure they don't violate the [Unwanted Software Policy](https://www.google.com/about/company/unwanted-software-policy.html) and [follow our guidelines](about:/search/docs/monitor-debug/security/malware#guidelines).

Misleading functionality
------------------------

Misleading functionality refers to the practice of intentionally creating sites that trick users into thinking they would be able to access some content or services but in reality can't. Examples of misleading functionality include:

*   A site with a fake generator that claims to provide app store credit but doesn't actually provide the credit
*   A site that claims to provide certain functionality (for example, PDF merge, countdown timer, online dictionary service), but intentionally leads users to deceptive ads rather than providing the claimed services

Scaled content abuse
--------------------

Scaled content abuse is when many pages are generated for the primary purpose of manipulating search rankings and not helping users. This abusive practice is typically focused on creating large amounts of unoriginal content that provides little to no value to users, no matter how it's created.

Examples of scaled content abuse include, but are not limited to:

*   Using generative AI tools or other similar tools to generate many pages without adding value for users
*   Scraping feeds, search results, or other content to generate many pages (including through automated transformations like synonymizing, translating, or other obfuscation techniques), where little value is provided to users
*   Stitching or combining content from different web pages without adding value
*   Creating multiple sites with the intent of hiding the scaled nature of the content
*   Creating many pages where the content makes little or no sense to a reader but contains search keywords

If you're hosting such content on your site, [exclude it from Search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/control-what-you-share).

Scraping
--------

Scraping refers to the practice of taking content from other sites, often through automated means, and hosting it with the purpose of manipulating search rankings. Examples of abusive scraping include:

*   Republishing content from other sites without adding any original content or value, or even citing the original source
*   Copying content from other sites, modify it only slightly (for example, by substituting synonyms or using [automated techniques](#scaled-content)), and republish it
*   Reproducing content feeds from other sites without providing some type of unique benefit to the user
*   Creating sites dedicated to embedding or compiling content, such as videos, images, or other media from other sites, without substantial added value to the user

Site reputation abuse
---------------------

Site reputation abuse is a tactic where third-party content is published on a host site mainly because of that host's already-established ranking signals, which it has earned primarily from its first-party content. The goal of this tactic is for the content to rank better than it could otherwise on its own.

Having third-party content alone isn't a violation of the site reputation abuse policy; it's only a violation if the third-party content is published on a host site mainly because of that host site's already-established ranking signals. Examples of site reputation abuse include, but are not limited to:

*   An educational site hosting a page about sponsored reviews of payday loans written by a third-party that distributes the same page to other sites across the web
*   A medical site hosting a third-party advertising page about "best casinos" that readers wouldn't expect and that's being placed on the site to rank better due to the established site's ranking signals
*   A movie review site hosting third-party pages about topics that would be confusing to users to find on a movie review site (such as "ways to buy followers on social media sites", the "best fortune teller sites", and the "best essay writing services")
*   A news site hosting coupons provided by a third-party white-label service where the main reason for publishing the coupons on the news site is to capitalize on the news site's reputation
*   An established first party site branches out into a new area primarily using freelance content because this content will rank better on the first-party site than it would have otherwise

If you're hosting pages that violate this policy, learn how to [correct this issue](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175#site-reputation-abuse&zippy=%2Csite-reputation-abuse).

Examples that are **NOT** considered site reputation abuse include:

*   Wire service or press release service sites
*   News publications that have syndicated news content from other news publications
*   Sites designed to allow user-generated content, such as a forum website or comment sections
*   Columns, opinion pieces, articles, and other work of an editorial nature
*   Third-party content (for example, "advertorial" or "native advertising" type pages) where the purpose is to share content directly to readers (such as through promotion within the publication itself), rather than hosting the content to manipulate search rankings
*   Using affiliate links throughout a page, with [links treated appropriately](#link-spam), or embedding third-party ad units throughout a page
*   Coupons that are sourced directly from merchants and other businesses that serve consumers

Sneaky redirects
----------------

Redirecting is the act of sending a visitor to a different URL than the one they initially requested. Sneaky redirecting is the practice of doing this maliciously in order to either show users and search engines different content or show users unexpected content that does not fulfill their original needs. Examples of sneaky redirects include:

*   Showing search engines one type of content while redirecting users to something significantly different
*   Showing desktop users a normal page while redirecting mobile users to a completely different spam domain

While sneaky redirection is a type of spam, there are many legitimate, non-spam reasons to redirect one URL to another. Examples of legitimate redirects include:

*   Moving your site to a new address
*   Consolidating several pages into one
*   Redirecting users to an internal page once they are logged in

When examining if a redirect is sneaky, consider whether or not the redirect is intended to deceive either the users or search engines. Learn more about how to appropriately [employ redirects on your site](about:/search/docs/crawling-indexing/301-redirects#jslocation).

Thin affiliation
----------------

Thin affiliation is the practice of publishing content with product affiliate links where the product descriptions and reviews are copied directly from the original merchant without any original content or added value.

Affiliate pages can be considered thin if they are a part of a program that distributes its content across a network of affiliates without providing additional value. These sites often appear to be cookie-cutter sites or templates with the same or similar content replicated within the same site or across multiple domains or languages. If a Search results page returned several of these sites, all with the same content, thin affiliate pages would create a frustrating user experience.

Not every site that participates in an affiliate program is a thin affiliate. Good affiliate sites add value by offering meaningful content or features. Examples of good affiliate pages include offering additional information about price, original product reviews, rigorous testing and ratings, navigation of products or categories, and product comparisons.

User-generated spam
-------------------

User-generated spam is spammy content added to a site by users through a channel intended for user content. Often site owners are unaware of the spammy content. Examples of spammy user-generated content include:

*   Spammy accounts on hosting services that anyone can register for
*   Spammy posts on forum threads
*   Comment spam on blogs
*   Spammy files uploaded to file hosting platforms

Here are several tips on how to [prevent abuse of your site's public areas](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/prevent-abuse). Here are our tips on [fixing hacked sites](https://web.dev/articles/hacked) and avoiding being hacked.

Other practices that can lead to demotion or removal
----------------------------------------------------

### Legal removals

When we receive a significant volume of [valid copyright removal requests](https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7347743) involving a given site, [we are able to use that](https://search.googleblog.com/2012/08/an-update-to-our-search-algorithms.html) to demote other content from the site in our results. This way, if there is other infringing content, people are less likely to encounter it versus the original content. We apply similar demotion signals to complaints involving defamation, counterfeit goods, and court-ordered removals. In the case of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), we always remove such content when it is identified and we demote all content from sites with a significant proportion of CSAM content.

### Personal information removals

If we process a significant volume of personal information removals involving a site with [exploitative removal practices](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9172218), we demote other content from the site in our results. [We also look to see](https://blog.google/products/search/improving-search-better-protect-people-harassment/) if the same pattern of behavior is happening with other sites and, if so, apply demotions to content on those sites. We may apply similar demotion practices for sites that receive a significant volume of removals of content involving [doxxing content](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9673730), [explicit personal imagery created or shared without consent](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6302812), or [explicit non-consensual fake content](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9116649).

### Policy circumvention

If a site continues to engage in actions intended to bypass our spam policies or [content policies for Google Search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10622781), we may take appropriate action which may include restricting or removing eligibility for some of our search features (for example, Top Stories, Discover) and taking broader action in Google Search (for example, removing more sections of a site from Search results). Circumvention includes but is not limited to:

*   Using existing or creating new subdomains, subdirectories, or sites with the intention of continuing to violate our policies
*   Using other methods intended to continue distributing content or engaging in a behavior that aims to violate our policies

### Scam and fraud

Scam and fraud come in many forms, including but not limited to impersonating an official business or service through imposter sites, intentionally displaying false information about a business or service, or otherwise attracting users to a site on false pretenses. Using automated systems, Google seeks to identify pages with scammy or fraudulent content and prevent them from showing up in Google Search results. Examples of online scams and fraud include:

*   Impersonating a well-known business or service provider to trick users into paying money to the wrong party
*   Creating deceptive sites pretending to provide official customer support on behalf of a legitimate business or provide fake contact information of such business
