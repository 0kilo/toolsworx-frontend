        "<strong>Q: How accurate is PDF to Word conversion and what formatting gets lost?</strong> Accuracy depends on PDF complexity. Simple text PDFs: 95%+ accuracy maintaining paragraphs, basic formatting, images embedded. Complex layouts: challenges with multi-column text (may merge incorrectly), text boxes (positioning approximate), tables (borders/cells may shift), headers/footers (placement varies). Fonts: embedded fonts preserved if available, substituted if missing (affects appearance). Images: typically extract well, quality matches PDF resolution. What's lost: exact spacing (PDFs use absolute positioning, Word uses flow layout), layered objects (PDFs flatten layers), form fields (convert to static text), annotations/comments (may disappear), embedded multimedia (videos, audio), digital signatures (invalidated). Scanned PDFs: require OCR (Optical Character Recognition), accuracy 85-98% depending on scan quality, creates editable text but not original formatting. Best results: PDFs originally created from Word convert better than complex desktop publishing (InDesign) or scanned documents.",
        "<strong>Q: Can I edit a PDF directly or must I always convert to Word first?</strong> PDF editing options: (1) Native PDF editors (Adobe Acrobat, PDF Expert) allow direct editing but expensive ($15-20/month), edit text, images, pages without conversion. (2) Free PDF editors (PDFescape, Sejda) limited features, simple text edits only. (3) Conversion to Word better for: major content changes, complex formatting adjustments, collaborative editing with track changes, cost-conscious users (free conversion vs paid PDF editor). When to edit PDF directly: minor typo fixes, form filling, annotation/comments, page manipulation (rotate, delete, merge), preserving exact layout critical. When to convert to Word: rewriting sections, reformatting layout, adding extensive content, leveraging Word features (styles, table of contents, mail merge). Hybrid approach: convert to Word for editing, export back to PDF for distribution. OCR PDFs: must convert (scanned PDFs are images not editable text) unless PDF editor includes OCR feature.",
        "<strong>Q: What's the difference between DOC and DOCX and which should I use?</strong> DOC (Word 97-2003): legacy binary format, limited to 32MB file size, compatibility with old Word versions (pre-2007), larger file sizes (no compression), proprietary Microsoft format. DOCX (Word 2007+): modern XML-based format, ZIP-compressed (smaller files), no practical file size limit, open standard (Office Open XML), better corruption recovery (XML readable), supports modern features (content controls, improved tables). When to use DOC: recipient explicitly requires (old Word 2003), legacy system imports only DOC, archive compatibility with very old documents. When to use DOCX: default for new documents (17+ years standard), smaller file size (50-75% smaller than DOC), better forward compatibility, Google Docs/LibreOffice support, modern Word features. Conversion: Word automatically converts, but test with recipient if unsure, legacy features may not translate perfectly. Industry standard: DOCX overwhelmingly preferred today, DOC essentially obsolete except specific legacy requirements.",
        "<strong>Q: How do I preserve hyperlinks, bookmarks, and table of contents when converting?</strong> Feature preservation varies by conversion path. PDF to Word: hyperlinks usually preserved (blue underlined text remains clickable), internal bookmarks may convert to Word bookmarks or lost, table of contents converts to text (no longer auto-updating, need to regenerate in Word). Word to PDF: hyperlinks fully preserved (clickable in PDF), bookmarks become PDF bookmarks (navigation panel), table of contents becomes static text with hyperlinks, cross-references work. HTML to PDF: hyperlinks preserved (internal and external), anchor links (#section) may break depending on converter, navigation depends on PDF generator. Best practices: after conversion verify all links click correctly, regenerate table of contents in Word (References > Table of Contents > Update), check bookmark panel in PDF viewer for navigation structure, test cross-references point to correct pages. Complex documents: consider manual review of converted file, automated conversion 80-90% reliable for links but edge cases exist.",
        "<strong>Q: Can I batch convert multiple documents or is it one file at a time?</strong> Batch conversion capabilities depend on tool and use case. Browser-based tools: typically single file due to memory/processing limits, uploading 50 files at once may crash browser tab, sequential conversion better (convert file, download, repeat). Desktop software: often supports batch conversion (Adobe Acrobat, Libre Office), select folder of files, convert all to target format, faster for large volumes (10+ files). Command-line tools: best for batch (pandoc, LibreOffice headless mode), scriptable for automation (convert all *.docx to PDF), integrate with file watchers for auto-conversion. Cloud services: some offer batch upload but process sequentially, careful with confidential documents (uploaded to third-party). DIY batch: use file conversion libraries (Python docx2pdf, pdf2docx), write script looping through directory, fully automated for recurring needs. Recommendation: under 5 files use browser tool sequentially, 5-50 files use desktop batch, 50+ files consider scripting or command-line tools."

      "content": [
        "💡 <strong>Review converted documents carefully before final distribution:</strong> Conversion artifacts: spacing changes (extra spaces, line breaks), font substitutions (similar but not identical), image repositioning (slightly off from original), table formatting shifts (column widths, borders), bullet/numbering restart (loses sequence). Review checklist: (1) Scan entire document checking layout, (2) Verify images display correctly and positioned properly, (3) Check tables align and contain all data, (4) Test hyperlinks click to correct destinations, (5) Review headers/footers on all pages, (6) Check page breaks occur at logical points. High-stakes documents: print preview both original and converted side-by-side, have second person review for fresh eyes, test print on actual printer if physical copies needed. Professional touch: fix minor formatting issues manually (adjust spacing, realign images), regenerate table of contents if document has one, update cross-references that may have shifted. Time investment: 5 minutes review for simple documents saves hours fixing problems discovered by recipient.",
        "💡 <strong>Use consistent font choices to minimize conversion issues:</strong> Font problems: conversion tools struggle with uncommon fonts (substitutes similar but not exact), embedded fonts may not extract from PDF, custom fonts appear as default fonts (Arial, Times) in converted document. Safe fonts: use web-safe fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri, Georgia, Verdana) for maximum compatibility, these fonts available on all systems, convert reliably across formats. Before conversion: if editing source document, consider switching to safe fonts before creating PDF, saves conversion headaches later. After conversion: check converted document uses intended fonts (File > Properties in Word), substitute manually if wrong font applied, consistency more important than exact match. Embedded fonts: when creating PDFs embed fonts (Acrobat > Preferences > Fonts) ensuring they display correctly on any system, makes future PDF-to-Word conversion more accurate. Font licensing: using commercial fonts in PDFs requires proper licensing, check terms before distribution.",
        "💡 <strong>Separate scanned PDFs from text PDFs for appropriate conversion approach:</strong> Scanned PDFs: images of paper documents, require OCR (Optical Character Recognition), lower conversion accuracy (85-98%), no formatting information (just text extraction), longer processing time. Text PDFs: created digitally (from Word, InDesign), contain actual text data, higher conversion accuracy (95%+), preserve some formatting, faster conversion. Identification: select text in PDF - if you can highlight/copy text it's text PDF, if clicking just selects whole page as image it's scanned. OCR considerations: scan quality matters (300+ DPI recommended), clean scans convert better (no coffee stains, smudges), languages other than English may need specific OCR engine, expect manual cleanup after OCR. Workflow: scanned PDFs best handled by specialized OCR software (Adobe Acrobat OCR, ABBYY FineReader) before standard conversion, yields better results than direct conversion, allows reviewing OCR accuracy before editing.",
        "💡 <strong>Preserve original files before conversion for rollback if needed:</strong> Conversion is lossy: some information always lost (metadata, exact formatting, comments), can't perfectly reverse conversion (Word to PDF to Word doesn't equal original Word), changes may be subtle but accumulate. Archive strategy: keep original source files permanently (Word documents, InDesign files, LaTeX source), treat PDFs as distribution format not source of truth, don't delete originals after conversion 'to save space' (conversion artifacts discovered later can't be fixed without original). Version control: meaningful filenames (Contract_v2.1_2024-01-15.docx, Contract_v2.1_FINAL.pdf), separate folder for originals vs converted versions, cloud backup of originals (Google Drive, Dropbox). Conversion workflow: (1) Start with original editable file, (2) Make changes, (3) Save as new version, (4) Convert to distribution format (PDF), (5) Distribute PDF keep original. If recipient requests edits: work from original editable version, never work from converted-back document (poor practice amplifying conversion errors).",
        "💡 <strong>Optimize PDF settings based on intended use - print vs screen:</strong> PDF optimization matters for file size and quality. Print PDFs: high resolution (300 DPI minimum), embed all fonts, CMYK color mode (printing standard), large file size acceptable (quality priority), no compression on images (prevents quality loss). Screen PDFs: lower resolution (150 DPI sufficient), font subsetting okay (reduces size), RGB color mode (screen standard), optimize for file size (faster download/email), compress images (JPEG compression level 70-80%). Settings in tools: Acrobat offers 'High Quality Print' vs 'Smallest File Size' presets, Word PDF export has 'Standard' vs 'Minimum size' options. Use cases: print PDFs for professional printing, client deliverables, archival, screen PDFs for email distribution, web download, online viewing, internal documents. File size impact: print PDF 5MB, screen PDF 500KB (same content, different optimization), email limits often 10-25MB making screen optimization practical necessity. Balance: most use screen PDFs today (digital distribution), only use print settings when physical printing confirmed."
