      "title": "Common Questions",
      "type": "list",
      "content": [
        "<strong>Q: How do I find where two functions intersect?</strong> Plot both functions on the same graph (they'll appear in different colors) and look for where the curves cross. The x-coordinate where they meet is the solution to setting the two functions equal. For example, to solve x² = 2x, graph y = x² and y = 2x - they intersect at x = 0 and x = 2. Zoom in if intersection points are close together or hard to see precisely.",
        "<strong>Q: Why does my graph look wrong or incomplete?</strong> Common issues: (1) Function has asymptotes or discontinuities (like 1/x at x=0) - the graph correctly shows gaps there. (2) You're zoomed in/out too far - adjust zoom to see the interesting parts. (3) You forgot parentheses - write (x+1)/(x-1) not x+1/x-1 which means x+(1/x)-1. (4) Undefined regions - sqrt(x) only shows for x≥0, sqrt(25-x²) only shows for |x|≤5.",
        "<strong>Q: How do I graph circles or ellipses?</strong> Circles and ellipses aren't functions (they fail the vertical line test), so graph them as two separate functions - top and bottom halves. For circle x²+y²=25, graph top half y = sqrt(25-x²) and bottom half y = -sqrt(25-x²). For ellipse x²/25 + y²/16 = 1, graph y = 4*sqrt(1-x²/25) and y = -4*sqrt(1-x²/25). Both halves together form the complete shape.",
        "<strong>Q: What's the best zoom level to see important features?</strong> Start with standard view (-10 to 10 on both axes). For polynomials, zoom out to see overall shape and end behavior - x³ and x⁵ look similar up close but very different zoomed out. For trig functions, set x-axis to show at least one full period (0 to 2π ≈ 6.28 for sin/cos). For 1/x or other rational functions, zoom to see asymptotes clearly. For exponentials, use unequal axes - wider x-range, narrower y-range.",
        "<strong>Q: How can I use graphs to understand derivatives?</strong> The derivative represents slope. Graph a function like x², then imagine the tangent line at different points - it's flat at x=0 (derivative = 0), slopes up as x increases (derivative = 2x > 0 for x > 0). Graph both f(x) = x² and f'(x) = 2x together - notice where f'(x) = 0 (at x=0), f(x) has a minimum. Where f'(x) > 0, f(x) is increasing. This visual connection helps tremendously in calculus."

      "title": "Pro Tips & Best Practices",
      "type": "list",
      "content": [
        "💡 <strong>Plot the derivative alongside the function:</strong> Understanding calculus becomes easier when you graph f(x) and f'(x) together. For f(x) = x³ - 3x, also plot f'(x) = 3x² - 3. Notice that wherever f'(x) crosses zero (at x = ±1), f(x) has a local max/min. Wherever f'(x) > 0, f(x) slopes upward. This visual connection makes derivatives intuitive instead of abstract.",
        "💡 <strong>Use strategic zooming to find roots:</strong> To solve equations graphically, plot both sides as separate functions and find intersections. If intersections aren't clear, zoom in progressively. To solve x³ = 5x - 2, graph y = x³ and y = 5x - 2. Initial view shows roughly 3 intersections. Zoom in on each to estimate roots to desired precision. This works when algebraic solutions are difficult or impossible.",
        "💡 <strong>Understand transformations by comparing side-by-side:</strong> To learn how coefficients affect shape, plot multiple variations. Graph x², 2x², 0.5x², -x² together to see vertical stretching/compression and reflection. Then try (x-2)², (x+1)², (x-2)²+3 to see horizontal and vertical shifts. Watching all versions simultaneously builds deep intuition for function transformations - crucial for precalculus and beyond.",
        "💡 <strong>Test limits by zooming on approach behavior:</strong> Calculus limits become clearer graphically. For lim(x→0) of sin(x)/x, graph y = sin(x)/x and zoom in near x = 0. You'll see the graph approaches y = 1 even though x=0 itself is undefined (hole in graph). For horizontal asymptotes, graph (2x²+1)/(x²+3) and zoom way out on x-axis - the function flattens toward y = 2 as x → ±∞.",
        "💡 <strong>Identify asymptotes and discontinuities:</strong> For rational functions like (x²-1)/(x-1), the graph shows a hole at x=1 (removable discontinuity) because top and bottom both have factor (x-1). Simplifies to y = x+1 except at x=1. Compare this to y = 1/(x-1) which has a vertical asymptote (graph shoots to ±∞) at x=1 - non-removable discontinuity. Understanding these visually prevents sign errors in calculus problems."
