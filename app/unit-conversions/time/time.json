      "title": "Common Questions",
      "content": [
        "<strong>Q: Why do months and years show as approximate values?</strong><br>Our converter uses standard approximations of 30 days per month and 365 days per year because actual calendar months vary from 28 to 31 days, and leap years add complexity. For precise date calculations spanning specific calendar periods, use a dedicated date calculator instead. This approach works perfectly for duration estimates and most practical applications where you need to know roughly how many seconds are in a month.",
        "<strong>Q: How do I convert response times for API optimization?</strong><br>When optimizing API performance, you'll often see millisecond measurements that need context. For example, a 250ms response time equals 0.25 seconds, which is generally acceptable for web applications. If you're seeing 2500ms, that's 2.5 seconds and likely needs optimization. Use our converter to quickly translate between milliseconds and seconds to understand if your API meets performance benchmarks.",
        "<strong>Q: What's the difference between scientific and everyday time units?</strong><br>Scientific applications typically work in precise SI units like nanoseconds, microseconds, and milliseconds because experiments and computer operations happen incredibly fast. A CPU instruction might take 1 nanosecond, while a chemical reaction might last 500 microseconds. Everyday applications use minutes, hours, and days. Understanding both scales helps when troubleshooting why your 100-millisecond database query feels slow but a 2-hour meeting feels eternal.",
        "<strong>Q: How accurate do I need to be when setting timeouts in code?</strong><br>It depends on your application. Network requests typically use timeouts in seconds or milliseconds like 5000ms for a 5-second timeout. Database queries might need 100-500ms precision. Real-time systems and trading applications need microsecond accuracy. Over-precise timeouts waste computation, under-precise ones cause frustration. Convert your requirements to the right unit and add 20-30% buffer for network variability.",
        "<strong>Q: Can I use this for calculating employee work hours?</strong><br>Absolutely. If someone works 37.5 hours per week, that's 2,250 minutes or 135,000 seconds. This helps when building payroll systems, tracking billable hours, or calculating overtime. Just remember to account for breaks and actual calendar working days. The converter handles the math so you can focus on business logic rather than multiplying by 60 or 3,600 repeatedly."

      "title": "Pro Tips & Best Practices",
      "content": [
        "💡 <strong>Memory Trick:</strong> Remember that 1 day equals approximately 86,400 seconds (think 86.4k) and you can mentally estimate other conversions. A week is roughly 600,000 seconds, making quick calculations much easier during meetings.",
        "💡 <strong>Programming Best Practice:</strong> Always store time durations in your database as seconds or milliseconds rather than mixed units. Convert to human-readable formats only when displaying to users. This prevents conversion bugs and makes calculations straightforward.",
        "💡 <strong>Precision Awareness:</strong> When working with nanoseconds or microseconds, be aware that system clock precision varies. Most operating systems can't actually measure individual nanoseconds. Use appropriate units for your actual precision needs to avoid false accuracy.",
        "💡 <strong>Timeout Strategy:</strong> For web applications, set API timeouts at 30 seconds (30,000ms), database queries at 5 seconds (5,000ms), and user interactions at 3 seconds (3,000ms). Convert these to your framework's required units using this tool to maintain consistent user experience.",
        "💡 <strong>Billing Accuracy:</strong> When calculating billable hours, convert everything to minutes first, then to decimal hours. 45 minutes becomes 0.75 hours, making invoicing calculations cleaner than working with mixed hour-minute formats."
