      "title": "Common Questions",
      "content": [
        "<strong>Q: Why does my 1TB hard drive only show 931GB of space?</strong><br>Hard drive manufacturers use decimal units where 1TB equals 1,000,000,000,000 bytes. However, operating systems report capacity in binary units (gibibytes) where 1GiB equals 1,073,741,824 bytes. When you divide 1 trillion bytes by 1,073,741,824, you get 931.32 GiB, which Windows displays as 931GB. You're not losing space; it's a unit conversion difference. This 7% discrepancy exists for all storage devices and is perfectly normal, though frustrating when planning storage needs.",
        "<strong>Q: How long will it take to download a 5GB file on my 100Mbps internet?</strong><br>Internet speeds are advertised in megabits per second (Mbps), but file sizes use megabytes (MB). First convert: 100Mbps equals 12.5MB/s (divide by 8 since 8 bits equal 1 byte). A 5GB file equals 5,000MB. At 12.5MB/s, download time is 5,000 ÷ 12.5 = 400 seconds or about 6.7 minutes. Real-world speeds are typically 60-80% of advertised, so expect 8-10 minutes. This converter eliminates the mental math and prevents the common mistake of using bits and bytes interchangeably.",
        "<strong>Q: What's the difference between MB and MiB and which should I use?</strong><br>MB (megabyte) uses decimal: 1MB = 1,000,000 bytes. MiB (mebibyte) uses binary: 1MiB = 1,048,576 bytes. The difference is about 4.9%. Most consumer applications and file systems use MB loosely, sometimes meaning MiB. Professional contexts and technical documentation should use MiB for precision. When reporting file sizes programmatically, use binary units (KiB, MiB, GiB) for accuracy. For casual communication, MB and GB are universally understood even if technically ambiguous.",
        "<strong>Q: How much data does streaming video actually use?</strong><br>Streaming quality directly affects data consumption. Standard definition (480p) uses about 0.7GB per hour, HD (720p) uses 1.5GB per hour, Full HD (1080p) uses 3GB per hour, and 4K uses 7GB per hour. If you have a 50GB monthly mobile data plan and watch one hour of HD video daily, that's 45GB monthly just for video, leaving only 5GB for other apps. Convert your plan limit to MB (50GB = 50,000MB) to track daily usage budgets (1,667MB per day average).",
        "<strong>Q: Why do computers use powers of 2 instead of 10 for memory?</strong><br>Computer architecture is based on binary (base-2) mathematics where everything operates in powers of two. Memory addresses, data buses, and registers all work in 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 bit increments. Using 1024 (2^10) instead of 1000 aligns perfectly with how computers actually store and address data. Storage manufacturers use decimal (1000) for marketing because it yields bigger numbers. This fundamental difference between how computers work (binary) and how we count (decimal) creates the KB vs KiB distinction."

      "title": "Pro Tips & Best Practices",
      "content": [
        "💡 <strong>Quick Download Math:</strong> To estimate download time, divide your file size in megabytes by your internet speed in megabits per second, then divide by 8. A 1000MB file on 50Mbps connection takes roughly (1000 ÷ 50) ÷ 8 = 2.5 minutes minimum. Add 30-40% for real-world overhead and network variability.",
        "💡 <strong>Storage Capacity Planning:</strong> When buying storage, calculate your actual needs in GiB, then add 20% overhead and convert to the TB value you should purchase. If you need 800GiB usable space, buy at least a 1TB drive (which provides 931GiB) to have comfortable headroom for system files and growth.",
        "💡 <strong>Mobile Data Tracking:</strong> Set your phone to display data usage in MB rather than GB for better granularity. 2.5GB sounds reasonable but 2,500MB makes you more conscious of consumption. Track background app usage weekly and convert to daily rates to identify data hogs before they drain your monthly allowance.",
        "💡 <strong>RAM Configuration:</strong> When upgrading computer memory, always use matching powers of 2: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB. Don't mix capacities unless necessary. A computer with 8GB installed has 8,192MiB available (8 × 1024). If you need more than 8GB for your workload, jump to 16GB rather than adding 4GB to make 12GB, which may not run in optimal dual-channel mode.",
        "💡 <strong>Bandwidth vs Storage:</strong> Internet bandwidth (speed) uses bits per second while storage uses bytes. Memorize that 1 byte = 8 bits. When your ISP advertises 1Gbps (gigabit per second) fiber, maximum download speed is 125MB/s (megabytes per second). A 1GB file downloads in 8 seconds at maximum speed, though real-world performance is usually 70-80% of theoretical maximum."
