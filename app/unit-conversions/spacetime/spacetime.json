      "title": "Common Questions",
      "content": [
        "<strong>Q: What is the Lorentz transformation and why do we need it?</strong><br>The Lorentz transformation describes how measurements of space and time change between observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other. Unlike Galilean transformations used in classical physics, Lorentz transformations account for the fact that light speed is constant for all observers. At everyday speeds below 1% of light speed, differences are negligible. But at 50% light speed, the Lorentz factor γ equals 1.15, meaning time runs 15% slower and lengths contract by 15% for the moving object. This tool calculates these precise transformations critical for high-energy physics and cosmology.",
        "<strong>Q: How does time dilation actually work in GPS satellites?</strong><br>GPS satellites orbit at about 14,000 km/h (3,900 m/s), causing their clocks to run slower by about 7 microseconds per day due to velocity-based time dilation. However, they also experience gravitational time dilation, running faster by about 45 microseconds daily because they're in weaker gravity. The net effect is clocks run 38 microseconds per day faster than Earth clocks. Without relativistic corrections, GPS accuracy would degrade by 10 kilometers per day. This demonstrates that special relativity isn't just theoretical; it's essential for modern technology.",
        "<strong>Q: Can you explain length contraction with a practical example?</strong><br>Imagine a spaceship traveling at 87% of light speed (0.87c). The Lorentz factor γ is 2, meaning from Earth's perspective, the spaceship appears exactly half its rest length. A 100-meter ship looks 50 meters long to stationary observers. Crucially, passengers inside experience no contraction of their own ship; they measure it as 100 meters. Instead, they see the distance between Earth and their destination contracted by half. This reciprocal nature is fundamental to relativity: each observer sees the other's reference frame contracted.",
        "<strong>Q: What happens to simultaneity in special relativity?</strong><br>Events that occur simultaneously in one reference frame may not be simultaneous in another moving frame. The time transformation equation t' = γ(t - vx/c²) shows that time measurements depend on both position (x) and velocity (v). If two explosions occur simultaneously (same t) but at different positions (different x) in your frame, someone moving relative to you will measure different times for these events. This relativity of simultaneity has no analog in everyday experience but becomes significant at relativistic speeds, fundamentally changing our understanding of now across different locations.",
        "<strong>Q: Why can't anything travel faster than light?</strong><br>The Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²) approaches infinity as velocity v approaches light speed c. This means that accelerating an object requires increasingly infinite energy as it nears light speed. Additionally, the object's mass effectively increases by the factor γ, making further acceleration ever more difficult. At exactly light speed, γ becomes undefined (division by zero). Only massless particles like photons can travel at light speed. This isn't a technological limitation but a fundamental property of spacetime geometry itself, embedded in the mathematics of Lorentz transformations."

      "title": "Pro Tips & Best Practices",
      "content": [
        "💡 <strong>Velocity Parameter:</strong> Physicists often use β = v/c (velocity as a fraction of light speed) instead of raw velocity. At β = 0.5 (half light speed), γ = 1.15. At β = 0.9 (90% light speed), γ = 2.29. At β = 0.99, γ jumps to 7.09. Memorize that significant relativistic effects appear above β = 0.3 (30% light speed), where γ exceeds 1.05 and time dilation becomes 5%.",
        "💡 <strong>Quick Estimation:</strong> For small velocities where β << 1, you can approximate γ ≈ 1 + ½β². This means at 10% light speed, γ ≈ 1.005, giving 0.5% time dilation. At 30% light speed, γ ≈ 1.045, giving 4.5% dilation. This approximation breaks down above 50% light speed but works great for initial estimates in problems.",
        "💡 <strong>Reference Frame Consistency:</strong> When solving relativity problems, clearly define which frame is primed (moving) and which is unprimed (stationary). Mixing frames causes errors. Choose your stationary frame based on what makes calculations simplest, often the lab frame or Earth frame. Remember that all inertial frames are equally valid; there's no absolute rest frame.",
        "💡 <strong>Causality Preservation:</strong> The invariant interval s² = c²t² - x² determines whether events can be causally connected. If s² > 0, the events are time-like separated and could have causal relationship. If s² < 0, they're space-like separated and cannot influence each other. This invariant remains the same in all reference frames, preserving cause and effect despite different observers measuring different times and distances.",
        "💡 <strong>Practical Calculations:</strong> When computing Lorentz transformations, work in units where c = 1 (setting time in light-seconds or distance in seconds times c) to simplify equations. Convert back to standard units at the end. Also, check limiting cases: at v = 0, transformations should reduce to x' = x and t' = t. At v approaching c, verify that γ grows without bound."
