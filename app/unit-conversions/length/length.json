      "content": [
        "<strong>Q: Why do different countries use different measurement systems?</strong> The US primarily uses imperial units (feet, inches, miles) inherited from British colonial times, while most of the world adopted the metric system in the late 1800s for its simplicity and decimal-based structure. The metric system is easier for scientific calculations.",
        "<strong>Q: How accurate are these conversions for construction?</strong> Our conversions use internationally recognized conversion factors accurate to 6+ decimal places, which exceeds the precision needed for most construction and engineering projects. Professional engineers worldwide trust these standard conversion factors.",
        "<strong>Q: What's the difference between a meter and a yard?</strong> A meter (m) is slightly longer than a yard (yd). 1 meter = 1.09361 yards, or about 9% longer. A meter is 39.37 inches while a yard is exactly 36 inches. This difference matters in construction and fabric measurements.",
        "<strong>Q: When should I use astronomical units like AU or light years?</strong> Use AU (Astronomical Units) for distances within our solar system - it's the Earth-Sun distance. Use light years or parsecs for interstellar distances. For example, Mars is 1.5 AU from the Sun, while the nearest star is 4.24 light years away.",
        "<strong>Q: Why does the tool include microns?</strong> Microns (micrometers, μm) are essential in manufacturing, semiconductor fabrication, biology, and materials science. For example, human hair is about 70-100 microns thick, and bacteria are measured in microns."

        "💡 <strong>Quick feet to meters:</strong> Divide feet by 3.28 to get approximate meters. For rough estimates, 3 feet ≈ 1 meter works well.",
        "💡 <strong>Remember the inch:</strong> 1 inch = exactly 2.54 cm. This is the fundamental conversion between imperial and metric - all others derive from this.",
        "💡 <strong>Construction rule:</strong> When working on international projects, always specify units explicitly in your measurements. Never assume - '5' means nothing without 'meters' or 'feet'.",
        "💡 <strong>Fabric shopping tip:</strong> When buying fabric internationally, remember 1 yard = 0.9144 meters. A 2-yard cut is about 1.83 meters, not 2 meters!",
        "💡 <strong>Running distances:</strong> A 5K race is 5 kilometers = 3.107 miles. A marathon (26.2 miles) = 42.195 kilometers. Memorize these for quick race conversions."
