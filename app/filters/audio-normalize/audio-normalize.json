        "Achieve consistent loudness across podcasts, videos, and music exports without manually riding faders or guessing peak levels.",
        "Protects against clipping while raising quiet passages, giving you a polished master ready for streaming services.",
        "Built for quick compliance with LUFS targets so your content matches platform standards and avoids automatic volume penalties.",
        "Simple, browser-based workflow that keeps private recordings local—no third-party uploads or account sign-ins needed.",
        "Ideal for creators batching many files; you can normalize intros, ads, and full episodes with the same trusted settings."

      "title": "Common Questions",
      "content": [
        "<strong>Q:</strong> What LUFS target should I choose? <strong>A:</strong> Use -14 LUFS for streaming music and YouTube, -16 to -20 LUFS for podcasts, and -23 LUFS for broadcast TV.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Does normalization change dynamics? <strong>A:</strong> Peak normalization only adjusts overall gain; loudness normalization may subtly reduce headroom but keeps dynamics intact compared to heavy compression.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Should I normalize before or after mastering? <strong>A:</strong> Normalize near the end—after EQ and compression—so your tonal balance stays consistent.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Will it fix clipping? <strong>A:</strong> It prevents new clipping but cannot repair already distorted peaks; re-record or use restoration tools if distortion exists.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Can I batch multiple files? <strong>A:</strong> Yes, apply the same target loudness to intros, interviews, and ads to keep episodes cohesive."

        "💡 Leave 1dB of true-peak headroom (-1dBTP) to prevent inter-sample peaks from clipping during streaming transcodes.",
        "💡 Normalize dialogue and music separately, then rebalance so speech stays clearly above background tracks by 3-6dB.",
        "💡 If exporting for radio, check gating thresholds and momentary max levels to ensure compliance with broadcast specs.",
        "💡 Use short fades on intros and outros after normalization to avoid clicks and to match loudness ramps across episodes.",
        "💡 Keep a reference playlist at target LUFS to compare tone and loudness before publishing."
