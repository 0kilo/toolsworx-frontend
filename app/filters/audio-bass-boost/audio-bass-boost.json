        "Precision low-end control that lets you enhance sub-bass without overwhelming the mix, giving your tracks a polished studio feel.",
        "Instantly fixes thin mobile or laptop recordings by adding body and weight, improving clarity on small speakers and earbuds.",
        "Built-in guardrails to prevent clipping so you can experiment with bold boosts while keeping output clean and distortion-free.",
        "Great for creators who need consistent bass translation across headphones, car stereos, and smart speakers without manual EQ tweaking.",

        "<strong>Q:</strong> How much bass boost is safe before distortion? <strong>A:</strong> Start with +3dB to +6dB and check peaks; the limiter prevents clipping but monitoring with headphones helps avoid muddy mixes.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Does this work on voice recordings? <strong>A:</strong> Yes—use gentle boosts around 120Hz to add warmth to podcast voices without emphasizing rumble or plosives.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Can I target only sub-bass? <strong>A:</strong> Focus on 30-60Hz for cinematic rumbles and kick weight while leaving mid-bass untouched for clarity.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Will boosting bass reduce overall volume? <strong>A:</strong> The tool automatically compensates gain so perceived loudness stays consistent while the low end thickens.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> How do I keep mixes from sounding boomy? <strong>A:</strong> Combine moderate boosts with high-pass filtering below 25Hz and compare on multiple playback systems."

        "💡 Use mid/side listening: boost lows in the mid channel while keeping the side channel neutral to avoid stereo smearing on headphones.",
        "💡 When mastering, limit boosts to 2-3dB and check LUFS so streaming platforms don’t turn your track down after processing.",
        "💡 Compare in mono—if the low end disappears, reduce stereo widening plugins before applying bass enhancement."
