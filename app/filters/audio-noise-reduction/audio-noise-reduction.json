        "✓ Fast cleanup for podcasts, screen recordings, and interviews so your audience focuses on the message—not the hiss or hum behind it. Perfect for content creators working on tight deadlines.",
        "✓ Adaptive reduction that preserves speech intelligibility, helping you avoid the warbly artifacts common with aggressive settings that destroy voice quality and natural tone.",
        "✓ Ideal for remote workers and creators who need professional-sounding audio without installing heavy desktop editing suites or learning complex software workflows.",
        "✓ Works locally in the browser, keeping confidential meeting audio and unreleased content private while you process without uploading sensitive recordings to cloud services.",
        "✓ Balances noise removal with dynamic preservation, so music beds and ambient textures stay natural instead of lifeless, maintaining authentic environmental character while reducing distractions."

      "content": [
        "<strong>Q:</strong> How much reduction is too much? <strong>A:</strong> Start around 30-40% reduction and raise slowly; if voices sound metallic, dial back sensitivity.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Can it remove keyboard clicks? <strong>A:</strong> Yes—use moderate reduction plus a gentle high-shelf cut to soften sharp transients.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Should I process before or after EQ? <strong>A:</strong> Remove noise first so EQ and compression work on clean signals and don’t amplify hiss.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Will this fix clipping? <strong>A:</strong> Noise reduction can’t fix distorted recordings; combine with proper gain staging or re-record if peaks are clipped.",
        "<strong>Q:</strong> Does it handle wind noise? <strong>A:</strong> Mild wind can be reduced; for heavy wind, use low-cut filtering and foam covers during recording."

        "💡 Capture a short room tone sample at the start of recordings; it helps identify consistent noise profiles to remove.",
        "💡 Combine light noise reduction with a low-cut filter at 80-100Hz to tame HVAC rumble without hollowing the voice.",
        "💡 For dialogue, prioritize intelligibility over absolute silence—slight ambience is better than robotic artifacts.",
        "💡 If removing laptop fan noise, process in two passes: a gentle first pass, then a targeted second pass for remaining hum.",
        "💡 After cleaning, normalize levels to -1dB and check LUFS so podcasts meet platform loudness recommendations."
