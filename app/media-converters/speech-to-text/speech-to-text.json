        "<strong>Q: What's the difference between live recording mode and file upload mode?</strong> Live recording mode: uses browser Web Speech API (built into Chrome, Edge, Safari), processes audio in real-time as you speak (instant transcription appears while talking), 100% FREE with unlimited use (no server costs, runs locally in browser), accuracy depends on browser implementation (Chrome generally best for English, varies by language), requires microphone permissions and active internet connection, background noise can impact accuracy. File upload mode: uses OpenAI Whisper API (state-of-the-art speech recognition model), processes pre-recorded audio files (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG up to 25MB), higher accuracy than live mode especially for challenging audio (accents, background noise, multiple speakers), limited to 3 transcriptions per 24 hours (API costs), supports same languages as live mode but often better recognition quality. When to use live mode: real-time dictation, meeting notes as conversation happens, accessibility for hands-free input, quick voice memos, situations requiring immediate transcription, unlimited transcription needs. When to use file mode: transcribing recorded interviews or podcasts requiring best accuracy, audio with background noise or accents where live mode struggles, editing pre-recorded content, situations where slight delay acceptable for better quality. Both modes: support 30+ languages, do not permanently store audio (live mode never leaves browser, file mode audio deleted after transcription), transcripts downloadable as text files.",
        "<strong>Q: How accurate is speech-to-text and what factors affect recognition quality?</strong> Accuracy depends on multiple factors: Audio quality: clear recording with minimal background noise (90-95% accuracy achievable), noisy environments like coffee shops or windy outdoor settings (70-85% accuracy), phone call quality or compressed audio (60-80% accuracy). Microphone quality: dedicated USB microphone or quality headset (best results), laptop built-in microphone (acceptable for quiet environments), smartphone or webcam microphone (variable quality). Speaker characteristics: native speaker with clear enunciation (highest accuracy), accents or non-native speakers (accuracy varies, file mode Whisper handles better), multiple speakers or overlapping speech (accuracy degrades, single speaker works best), speaking pace (moderate speed optimal, very fast or slow speech degrades accuracy). Language: English has highest accuracy (most training data), popular languages like Spanish, French, Chinese have good support, less common languages may show lower accuracy, technical jargon or proper nouns often misrecognized (medical terms, brand names, person names). Typical accuracy ranges: clean audio, clear speech, supported language (90-98% word accuracy), normal recording conditions (80-90% accuracy), challenging audio or accents (70-85% accuracy), very noisy or poor quality (50-70% accuracy). Improving accuracy: use quality microphone in quiet environment, speak clearly at moderate pace, file mode Whisper generally 5-10% more accurate than live browser mode for same audio, edit transcript after generation correcting errors (medical transcription, legal depositions require human review). Realistic expectations: even professional transcription services achieve 95-98% accuracy, expect to review and edit output especially for critical applications (legal documents, medical records, published content).",
        "<strong>Q: Can I transcribe audio files in languages other than English?</strong> Yes - both live and file modes support 30+ languages with varying accuracy levels. Well-supported languages (high accuracy): English (US, UK), Spanish (Spain, Mexico), French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, Korean. Good support (good accuracy): Vietnamese (with tone support), Arabic, Hindi, Russian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Thai, Indonesian. Additional supported languages (moderate accuracy): Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Czech, Romanian, Ukrainian, plus others. Language-specific considerations: tonal languages (Vietnamese, Chinese) benefit from file mode Whisper better handling tone distinctions, dialects matter (Mexican Spanish vs Spain Spanish, UK English vs US English), technical vocabulary accuracy varies by language (English medical terms recognized better than equivalent in less common languages). Multilingual transcription: can switch languages between sessions (select language before recording or uploading), single audio file with mixed languages may confuse recognition (stick to primary language), code-switching (mixing languages mid-sentence) poorly supported (transcribe in dominant language). Accuracy comparison across languages: English typically highest accuracy baseline (most training data), popular European languages (Spanish, French, German) achieve 85-95% of English accuracy, Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese) achieve 75-90% depending on dialect and audio quality, less common languages may achieve 60-80% accuracy. Practical recommendation: test with short sample in your target language, evaluate accuracy for your specific use case (accent, vocabulary, audio quality), file mode Whisper generally handles non-English languages better than browser live mode, expect to spend more time editing non-English transcripts compared to English."

      "content": [
        "💡 <strong>Choose the right transcription mode based on your use case:</strong> Use live mode for: real-time meeting notes (transcribe as conversation happens), hands-free dictation while multitasking, quick voice memos needing instant text, unlimited transcription needs (no daily limits), situations where slight inaccuracy acceptable (can re-speak unclear portions). Use file mode for: recorded interviews, podcasts, lectures requiring best accuracy, audio with background noise or challenging conditions (Whisper AI more robust), transcribing accents or non-native speakers (better recognition), final transcripts for publication or critical use (legal, medical, business documents). Live mode advantages: instant results, unlimited use, completely free, no file size limits, totally private (never leaves browser). File mode advantages: higher accuracy (5-15% better word recognition), handles difficult audio better (noise, accents, multiple speakers), supports longer audio files (up to 25MB), processes while you work on other tasks. Hybrid approach: use live mode for initial draft during meeting, re-transcribe critical portions with file mode recording for accuracy, combine both modes maximizing free live transcription with targeted file uploads for important segments.",
        "💡 <strong>Optimize audio quality for best transcription accuracy:</strong> Microphone selection: dedicated USB microphone beats laptop built-in (Blue Yeti, Audio-Technica AT2020 excellent for transcription), headset with boom microphone good for live dictation (reduces ambient noise), lavalier/lapel microphone ideal for interviews (captures speaker clearly), avoid webcam or phone microphones when possible (lower quality). Recording environment: quiet room with minimal background noise (close windows, turn off fans/AC during recording), soft furnishings reduce echo (carpet, curtains, furniture dampen sound reflections better than hard surfaces), position microphone 6-12 inches from mouth (closer risks plosives, farther reduces volume and clarity), use pop filter for live recording reducing harsh 'p' and 'b' sounds. Recording settings for file upload: WAV or FLAC lossless format preferred (preserves full audio quality for transcription), 44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate standard (higher unnecessary, lower degrades quality), mono recording acceptable for single speaker (stereo unnecessary, doubles file size without benefit), avoid heavy compression (MP3 below 128kbps may degrade transcription accuracy). Speaking technique: moderate pace (not too fast or slow), clear enunciation (avoid mumbling), pause briefly between sentences (helps speech recognition segment properly), minimize filler words (um, uh, like) if possible though modern AI handles these. Post-recording: use noise reduction filter cautiously if needed (Audacity, Adobe Audition can remove background hum without degrading speech), normalize volume to consistent level (ensures speech detected reliably), trim silence from beginning and end (speeds up processing).",
        "💡 <strong>Review and edit transcripts systematically to catch recognition errors:</strong> Common error patterns: homophones (there/their/they're, to/too/two) - context-dependent, proper nouns (names, places, brands) often misrecognized, technical terminology (medical terms, industry jargon, acronyms) may appear as common words, numbers and dates (5 vs five, 2020 vs twenty twenty) formatting inconsistent. Systematic review process: (1) Read through entire transcript comparing to audio for major errors, (2) Focus on names and technical terms (most common errors), (3) Check numbers, dates, and monetary amounts for accuracy, (4) Verify punctuation and paragraph breaks make sense, (5) Listen to unclear sections again at reduced playback speed. Editing efficiency tips: use find-and-replace for recurring errors (consistently misspelled name, technical term), create custom dictionary or glossary for domain-specific vocabulary (medical terminology, company names, product names), note common misrecognitions to re-speak more clearly in future, consider  speaker identification (label who said what in multi-speaker transcripts). Quality standards by use case: casual notes (minimal editing, accept 80-90% accuracy), business documentation (review all content, 95% accuracy minimum), legal/medical transcripts (professional transcriptionist review required, 98%+ accuracy critical, liability concerns), published content (thorough editing, perfect grammar and punctuation). Time investment: expect 1 hour editing per 1 hour audio for professional quality transcript (faster if audio quality good and vocabulary standard), casual notes may need only 10-15 minutes editing per hour audio (skim for major errors), very challenging audio may require 2-3 hours editing per hour audio."
