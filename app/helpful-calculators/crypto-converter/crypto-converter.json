        "<strong>Q: Why doesn't this match my exchange quote?</strong><br>Exchanges add fees and spreads. This tool shows mid-market reference rates refreshed every 30 minutes, so your exchange may differ by a few percent depending on liquidity and fees.",
        "<strong>Q: Can I use this for taxes?</strong><br>Use it only as a starting estimate. Tax filings often require timestamps and source-of-truth records from exchanges or wallets. Always confirm figures with official transaction data.",
        "<strong>Q: How many decimals should I trust?</strong><br>Values are provided up to 8 decimals for precision, but for everyday planning it is best to round to 2-4 decimals to avoid false accuracy.",
        "<strong>Q: What about stablecoins?</strong><br>Stablecoins like USDT or USDC are treated like any other token. Temporary depegs or liquidity gaps may cause slight differences from their intended $1 value.",
        "<strong>Q: Does this include historic prices?</strong><br>The calculator focuses on current snapshot rates. For historical tracking, capture exports regularly or consult dedicated price history tools."

        "💡 <strong>Round for Sanity:</strong> After converting, round to two decimals when sharing with non-technical audiences so numbers stay readable.",
        "💡 <strong>Check Multiple Fiats:</strong> Convert the same crypto amount to USD, EUR, and your local currency to spot rate gaps or card conversion costs.",
        "💡 <strong>Volatility Buffer:</strong> For budgets, add a 5-10% buffer to account for price movement between now and when you actually swap.",
        "💡 <strong>Snapshot Exports:</strong> Export and share results before a meeting so everyone references the same timestamped value.",
