      "content": [
        "<strong>Q: Does this tool validate that email addresses are real and deliverable?</strong> No - this tool extracts text patterns matching email format (user@domain.com), doesn't verify domain exists or mailbox is valid. Extracted emails may include: typos (usre@gmail.com), fake addresses (test@test.com), deprecated domains (@aol.com that user abandoned), role addresses (no-reply@), disposable emails (tempmail services). For validation: use email verification APIs (ZeroBounce, NeverBounce, Hunter.io) after extraction to check deliverability, DNS records, mailbox existence. This tool does format validation only (correct @ placement, domain structure), not deliverability validation.",
        "<strong>Q: Can this tool extract emails from images or PDFs?</strong> No - this tool works on text only. For extracting from PDFs: use PDF text extraction tool (pdftotext, Adobe Reader copy-paste, pdf.js), paste extracted text here. For images: use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) first - Google Vision API, Tesseract, built-in OCR in Adobe Acrobat, then paste OCR text here. Workflow: PDF/image → OCR tool → text → paste here → extract emails. OCR accuracy affects results - review extracted emails for OCR errors (O vs 0, I vs 1, rn vs m).",
        "<strong>Q: Why are some email addresses not being extracted?</strong> Common reasons: (1) Uncommon TLDs - emails with new TLDs (.xyz, .tech, .io) might not match regex pattern. (2) Internationalized domains - emails with non-ASCII characters (Chinese, Arabic domains) use Punycode encoding, may not match. (3) Obfuscated emails - 'user [at] domain [dot] com' or 'user@domain(dot)com' (anti-spam obfuscation) won't match standard email regex. (4) Emails split across lines with hyphenation. (5) Invalid characters - spaces in email ('user name@domain.com') isn't valid. For obfuscated emails: manually de-obfuscate first, then extract.",
        "<strong>Q: How do I avoid extracting unwanted email-like patterns?</strong> Text may contain email-like patterns that aren't real emails: code examples (user@localhost, test@example.com), file paths (C:\\user@machine\\file), version tags (package@1.0.0), social handles (@username), obfuscated text (AT_GMAIL_DOT_COM). This tool extracts anything matching email regex - can't distinguish context. To filter: (1) Review extracted list manually. (2) Remove known fake domains (example.com, test.com, localhost). (3) Filter by domain whitelist (only @company.com emails). (4) Remove role addresses (noreply@, admin@, info@) if targeting individuals.",
        "<strong>Q: Is it legal to extract emails from websites or documents?</strong> Legal depends on context and jurisdiction. Generally allowed: extracting from your own data (customer emails from your database/logs), publicly available contact info (business websites, public directories), emails with permission (conference attendee lists you have rights to). Restricted/illegal: scraping emails from websites for spam (violates CAN-SPAM, GDPR), harvesting from social media (violates Terms of Service), extracting from protected documents without authorization. GDPR: personal data processing requires legal basis. Safe use: extract emails from sources you own/have rights to, use for legitimate business purposes, provide unsubscribe options. Consult lawyer for specific use case."

      "content": [
        "💡 <strong>Always validate extracted email lists before using for outreach:</strong> Sending to invalid emails damages sender reputation, increases bounce rate, may get you blacklisted. After extraction: (1) Remove obvious fakes (test@, admin@example.com). (2) Check for typos in common domains (gmial.com vs gmail.com). (3) Use email verification service for bulk validation. (4) Start with small test batch before full campaign. (5) Monitor bounce rates. Invalid emails waste money (email service costs per send) and hurt deliverability for future campaigns.",
        "💡 <strong>Combine with CRM deduplication to avoid double-contacting people:</strong> Extracted emails may already exist in CRM, double-adding causes: duplicate contact records, multiple marketing emails to same person (annoying, unprofessional), skewed analytics (one person counted twice). Before importing extracted emails: export existing CRM contacts, compare lists (Excel VLOOKUP, Python set operations), only import new emails. Most CRMs have deduplication rules - configure to detect duplicates by email, merge records automatically. For one-time extract: paste both lists into Google Sheets, use UNIQUE function.",
        "💡 <strong>Extract emails from email client exported conversations for contact building:</strong> Email clients (Gmail, Outlook) export as .eml or .mbox files containing full conversation history including CC/BCC addresses. Workflow: export email folder/thread, open in text editor (emails are plain text with headers), copy all text, paste here, extract emails. Useful for: building contact list from project communications, finding all participants in long email thread, extracting vendor contacts from years of correspondence. Remember to respect privacy - only extract from emails you're authorized to process.",
        "💡 <strong>Use domain filtering after extraction to segment by organization:</strong> After extracting mixed email list (customers, vendors, partners), segment by domain for targeted communication: extract all, copy to spreadsheet, use formula to extract domain (=RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-FIND(\"@\",A1))), sort/filter by domain. Example use: conference attendee list with mix of companies → extract all → filter by @targetcompany.com → focused outreach to specific company. Or filter personal emails (@gmail.com) vs business (@company.com) for B2B vs B2C targeting.",
        "💡 <strong>Be aware of email extractors being used for spam - add protections to your contact forms:</strong> If publishing emails on website, know that spammers use extraction tools like this. Protections: (1) Use contact forms instead of displaying email. (2) Obfuscate emails (user [at] domain [dot] com). (3) Use JavaScript to render email (spambots often don't execute JS). (4) Use image of email address (not scrapable). (5) Implement CAPTCHA on contact form. Trade-off: these reduce spam but also reduce legitimate contact convenience. Balance based on spam volume. For critical contacts, use multiple methods (LinkedIn, Twitter, contact form) so one obfuscated email is acceptable."
